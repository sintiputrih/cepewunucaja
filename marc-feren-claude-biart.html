The 53-year-old was consequently extradited on Monday and flown to Milan to face trial.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-321944 alt="Marc Feren Claude Biart Deplaning" width=900 height=570 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/marc-feren-claude-biart-deplaning.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-321944 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>Biart made sure to hide his face across all of his YouTube cooking clips, but failed to obscure his tattoos.</span></p><p>For the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, Biart’s arrest was the latest in a string of successful operations aimed to cripple the ‘Ndrangheta syndicate.</p><p>The global law enforcement office joined forces with numerous European police authorities in 2020 in an assault on the Mafia syndicate that INTERPOL says is present “on every world continent.”</p><p>Biart’s arrest was followed by the arrest of another mafioso, Fransesco Pelle, who has been a fugitive for 14 years. He was caught while receiving COVID-19 treatment at a Lisbon, Portugal, clinic.</p><p>His criminal résumé included ordering the murder of a rival clan’s boss, who miraculously survived the assault, though his wife did not. The attempt was part of a feud between the Pelle-Romeo and Nirta-Strangio families, which saw six people murdered in Duisburg, Germany, in 2007.</p><p>Biart’s arrest was also preceded by that of Marco Di Lauro of the infamous <a href=# rel=noopener>Camorra Mafia</a> in 2019. The mobster was eating pasta when authorities barged in and found him sitting with two cats in a Naples apartment. Like Pelle, Di Lauro had been a fugitive for 14 years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-321943 alt="Police With Marc Feren Claude Biart" width=900 height=566 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/police-with-marc-feren-claude-biart.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-321943 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>Biart after being extradited to Milan, where the Carabinieri, Italy’s law enforcement outfit, received him with open arms.</span></p><p>As it stands, the ‘Ndrangheta group is undergoing one of Italy’s most comprehensive mob trials in 30 years. It took more than three hours to read the 355 defendants’ names during a pre-trial hearing for the historic case.</p><p>Officials estimate that the landmark Mafia trial, which is being held in the ‘Ndrangheta organization’s hometown of Calabria, will likely last two years. It will revolve around murders, kidnappings, and the international drug trade. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to</a> the BBC, more than 900 witnesses are expected to testify come January 2022, against the likes of Biart.</p><p>Oxford University Professor of Criminology Federico Varese said that the trial will be eye-opening for the people of Italy, exposing how deeply ‘Ndrangheta drug smugglers, murderers, and loan sharks are ingrained in the society.</p><p>“It’s shocking that you have a criminal group so rooted in the territory you have to put hundreds of people on trial,” he said.</p><p>After reading about the Mafia fugitive who was caught after posting videos of himself giving cooking lessons on YouTube, learn about the <a href=#>world’s biggest criminal organizations</a>.
