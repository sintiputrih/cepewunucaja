How does it feel now that “Monsters” has finally been released?</strong></p><p>“Hi! It’s been quite a long journey with this release and I’m so hyped and excited that it’s finally out. The idea for this project has been in the works for more than a year, so I couldn’t be more than happy to share the final result with everyone.”</p><p><strong>The song definitely has a sense of nostalgia and reminds many of us of the fear of monsters we may have had as children. Was that the intention?</strong></p><p>“The message behind ‘Monsters’ definitely reminds me, and probably the majority of listeners, of childhood and the overwhelming fear of imaginary monsters. But in this song, I would say that the monster is a metaphor for all of the unfounded fears that we are living with day to day. The monster could be anything – fear, uncertainty, doubts, etc. The song is meant to inspire people to fight these monsters mentally since they are all just in our heads.”</p><p><strong><strong>A children’s choir sings on the chorus. How did that come about?</strong></strong></p><p>“The children’s choir gives the majestic feel and strength to the song that I imagined. I had a few versions of this song in mind, but this version seemed different and catchy. Also, the choir gives that anthemic vibe that makes you want to sing along.”</p><p><strong><strong>How did 24kGoldn get involved?</strong></strong></p><p>“As I mentioned before, I have been developing this track for more than a year. My team and I were searching for fitting vocals and I was extremely happy when I got the opportunity to work with 24kGoldn after our teams connected us.”</p><p><strong><strong>What was it like collaborating with him on the track?</strong></strong></p><p>“24kGoldn is a very talented artist, so the experience is priceless. He delivered the vibe and idea perfectly, absolutely giving this track justice.”</p><p><strong>Will you two work together again in the future?</strong></p><p>“We’ll see…”</p><p><strong>Now onto the music video… what was it like to have that filmed in the midst of the pandemic?</strong><strong></strong></p><p>“It didn’t impact the music video creation at all since I had a younger version of me featured. And that was a very cool idea, giving me and others a chance to participate in the music video without being there together physically.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exclusive-dynoro-discusses-spooky-24kgoldn-collaboration-monsters-02.jpeg><p><strong>It seemed like you had a lot of fun with the video treatment… what is your favourite scene from it and why?</strong><strong></strong></p><p>“To be honest, it’s too hard to pick one scene since the kids have done such a good job with those martial arts moves. For me, this music video has a perfect balance telling the story from the beginning till the end- the amazing kids’ acting skills, the wholesome aesthetics and of course 24Goldn’s performance with his mini me.”</p><p><strong>Which artists would you like to collaborate with next?</strong></p><p>“I have a few artists in mind who I would like to work with, but I would prefer keeping this to myself and hopefully you’ll see this collab in near future. Don’t want to jinx it…”</p><p><strong>Can we expect any more music from you soon?</strong></p><p>“It was a long break after my previous release and I’m working on a few projects right now, so I hope to release one of them shortly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exclusive-dynoro-discusses-spooky-24kgoldn-collaboration-monsters-03.jpeg><p><strong>“Finally, do you have anything to say to your supporters?”</strong></p><p>“Yeah, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of my supporters and everybody who listens to my music. This music journey has been and still is a crazy ride and I wouldn’t be able to share my passion and love for the music without them, so thank you all!”</p><p>We would also like to thank Dynoro for taking the time out to talk to us!</p><p>You can listen to Dynoro and 24kGoldn’s “Monsters” and watch the official music video below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Make sure to follow Dynoro and 2kGoldn on social media:</p><p>Dynoro: <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Instagram</a></p><p>2kGoldn: <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Instagram</a></p><p><strong>Let us know your thoughts over on Twitter @<a href=#>CelebMix</a>!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksrmvy66qoq6VYrG6us6rpmacmaiwtr%2FSnqpmamSgtLC4w6dknKecoa6ju9Gaq6KnnmK6sLrSrZyrq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
