At every end is a new beginning. So now I’m taking this end and starting something else, and I’m not there yet.”</p><p>The singer’s shining moment on the competition was when he performed a powerful rendition of Queen’s “Somebody to Love.” His interpretation of the song even managed to knock <b><a href=#>Adele</a></b> out of the top spot on the iTunes chart at the time.</p><p>“It was so unexpected, and I didn’t even expect myself to do some of those things, and then I watched it back, and I was like, ‘What did I do? Oh, my gosh, what happened?’” he recounted to <i>Us</i>. “But it was just so crazy, and it showed me the little pieces that Adam’s been bringing out [of me] all season.… I realized that he’s been slowly bringing out an artist that I had inside of me that I didn’t know about.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavp5mYsm6%2F05qpZqKfp7GiuoyspKKsmGK6or7RopysZZuntrTAxKdknZ2eo8Zutc1mop6mpKqwrMWMsGlqaWJtf3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
