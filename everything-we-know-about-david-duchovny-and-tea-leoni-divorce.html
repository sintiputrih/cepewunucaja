Of course, it should go without saying that most famous people don’t have any serious money issues since stars tend to be paid a fortune for their work. With all of that in mind, most people may have assumed that the vast majority of celebrity couples would go the distance. Sadly, there have been <a href=#>loads of celebrity divorces</a> that garnered loads of attention in the press. On top of that, there have been some <a href=#>incredibly costly celebrity divorces</a> as a result of the aforementioned fortunes they tend to have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that so many stars have gotten divorced over the years, it makes sense that some of those splits have largely been forgotten. For example, when David Duchovny and Téa Leoni initially got divorced, that fact was covered in the press but their split seems to be all but forgotten these days. For that reason, a lot of people seem to know next to nothing about Téa Leoni and David Duchovny’s divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Update On These 13 Recently Divorced Celebrity Couples</a></span></p><h2 id=david-and-t-eacute-a-39-s-time-together-and-initial-split>David And Téa's Time Together And Initial Split</h2><p>According to reports, Téa Leoni and David Duchovny met in 1997 and they hit it off right from the start. In fact, Leoni and Duchovny had reportedly only been a couple for eight weeks when they walked down the aisle. During their marriage, Leoni and Duchovny would have a daughter named Madeline in 1999 and a son named Kyle in 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After several years of marriage, Téa Leoni and David Duchovny announced they had separated in 2008 and at that time it was revealed that he was going to get treatment for addiction to intimate encounters. Of course, <a href=#>lots of stars have battled addiction</a> but Duchovny’s need for intimate encounters still received a lot of breathless coverage in the media. After reuniting in 2009, Duchovny and Leoni separated again in 2011 and they finalized their divorce in 2014. According to a New York Daily News report from that time, Duchovny agreed to pay $40,000 in spousal support and $8,333 in child support on top of paying for his kid’s educations. More importantly, Leoni and Duchovny agreed to share custody of their children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is 'X-Files' Star David Duchovny's Girlfriend?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=t-eacute-a-leoni-reflects-on-their-relationship>Téa Leoni Reflects On Their Relationship</h2><p>Since he has been a famous actor for almost three decades at the time of this writing, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that David Duchovny has taken part in loads of interviews. Despite talking to members of the press and media so much over the years, Duchovny has managed to rarely answer questions about his personal life. For example, Duchovny has mostly avoided discussing his feelings about his marriage to Téa Leoni ending in divorce.</p><p>Unlike her ex-husband, Téa Leoni has at times seemed to be more of an open book when talking to the press. As a result, she has provided several quotes about her life post-divorce. For example, in 2015, she was interviewed by someone from More magazine and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leoni didn’t mince words when addressing how she generally feels about her life post-divorce</a>. “[I’m] divorced and liking it, thank you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elsewhere in that aforementioned interview, Téa Leoni was frank about the fact that co-parenting with David Duchovny can be very frustrating while also putting that in the right perspective. “On occasion, I want to throttle him. But in any real relationship with someone you love, that’s true.” Finally, Leoni claimed that she’ll “never speak again” about her relationships “especially after what it did to my kids”. As it turns out, that seems to be a statement Leoni has stood by since she avoids talking about her current longstanding relationship with actor Tim Daly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Co-Stars Who Fell In Love On The Set Of A Comedy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roughly a year before Téa Leoni was interviewed by More magazine, she spoke to Parade about her post-divorce relationship with David Duchovny in 2014. First off, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leoni addressed the fact that Duchovny gave her the things that matter most to her</a> in the world. "Listen, David gave me the two greatest gifts on the planet; I don't know how I could ever hate him. We've always loved each other, and we adore these kids." Next, Leoni admitted that being divorced can be hard., "I'm not playing stupid—I understand feelings can get hurt and things can get icky. We've had our moments like that. But these kids are too important, and he feels the same way. I know it. He's a good guy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the aforementioned Parade interview, Téa Leoni then talked about her kids’ attempts to play her and David Duchovny against one another. "There was that brief moment when the kids said, 'Oh, I can work a scam on you here and him over there,' and we were like, 'News flash—no!'" Finally, Leoni finished up by talking about her conscious decision to keep her kids close to their family. "L.A. is good for like four days, and then you've gotta get out. I wanted my kids close to my parents and David's mother. I wanted them to get to know their grandparents." Based on all of Leoni’s public statements about the repercussions of her divorce, she and Duchovny seem to have handled the situation as well as anyone could.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Is David Duchovny's Daughter Madelaine West Following In Her Dad's Footsteps?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRisaLCyJ1kna2Tnby3uthmmKecXamyonnLnqanoV2Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
