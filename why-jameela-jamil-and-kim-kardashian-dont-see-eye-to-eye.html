"You don't need your shape corrected or hidden."</p><p>Kardashian quickly responded to the critiques on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>,&nbsp;claiming the&nbsp;line was "not to slim but to support." She added that the fabric over the stomach supports the lower back, and the form-fitting leggings alleviate pain associated with swelling. "Based on the majority of positive feedback we have received so far from pregnant women around the world, I am incredibly proud to provide a solution that will provide comfort and support during the times that we all need it most, during pregnancy and after," she concluded. A few outlets then published headlines <a href=#>pitting Jamil and Kardashian against each other</a> once again.</p><p>Jamil is over it, though. "Bored of my name being used to drag me into sh-t that I'm not trying to be involved in," she wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, "If I was calling her out, I would just call her out," she said, "I'm extremely direct." Ain't that the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xmbn94e9ahsGaikaKyprjAZqGapZmheqK6w2aioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmKxsLrTZqqenV2axqZ506hknrGVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
