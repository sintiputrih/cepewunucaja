I try not to play favorites when it comes to recipes, but this one is something special. It’s that rare sort of dish that really can do it all. Make it on a Sunday for lunches all week, or serve it as a side dish at your Thanksgiving dinner. No matter when you eat it, I think you’ll savor every bite. Wheat berries may not be the trendiest grain these days, but if you try them here,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I lived in Austin, I bought wheat berries all the time from the bulk bins at our grocery store. But when we moved to Chicago, I couldn’t find them anywhere – not in bulk, not pre-bagged, nothing. Finally, this fall, I noticed a local wheat grower selling organic wheat berries at our farmers market. I love pairing this earthy whole grain with autumn ingredients like squash, kale, and dried cranberries, so I knew I had to get some. Since then, I’ve been tossing wheat berries into salads and side dishes like crazy! For how delicious they are, I don’t…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I’m making a salad in the fall, there’s a good chance that I’ll drizzle an apple cider vinegar dressing on top. Maybe it’s because fall is apple season, but there’s something irresistible about the combination of apple cider vinegar and autumn foods like cranberries and squash. In a hearty salad or side dish, an apple cider vinaigrette adds a tangy pop of flavor that brings these sweet ingredients to life. I’ve made a million apple cider vinegar dressing recipes over the years. Some are spiced with cinnamon, others are infused with sage, but the recipe below is the one…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This easy apple cake recipe is simple and delicious—the perfect treat for a crisp fall day. The batter comes together in one bowl, and it bakes up into a moist, tender cake that’s delicious for dessert, breakfast, or an afternoon snack. It’s packed with fresh apples, and brown sugar and cinnamon fill it with rich, spiced flavor. On a gray afternoon, nothing lifts my spirits like a slice of this apple cake. The recipe comes from&nbsp;Yossy Arefi’s cookbook Snacking Cakes: Simple Treats for Anytime Cravings,&nbsp;a gorgeous collection of 50 snacking cake recipes that are easy to make and acceptable to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>One of my many missions in life is to create fresh beet recipes that will win over even the biggest beet skeptics. Luckily, Jack has given me ample practice over the years. When we first met, he wouldn’t come near a beet, let alone taste one. But with time (and only a little trickery), I’ve gotten him to try and enjoy a host of beet recipes. Just last week, he devoured an entire beet salad at dinner, proclaiming how much he loved it with every bite. So if you’re still on the fence about beets, I get it. Their earthy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Just look at those beautiful beet greens! So often, vegetable stems, stalks, and tops like beet greens are written off as scraps and tossed in the trash. But why? Radish greens pulse into a beautiful pesto, carrot tops create a zesty chimichurri, and cauliflower cores blend into ultra-creamy soups and sauces. We might not eat these parts of vegetables every day, but they’re certainly not scraps. So let’s talk beet greens! They have a mild, sweet, and earthy flavor, and they take on a delicate, silky texture when cooked. Honestly, I think they’re just as tasty as beets themselves. Try…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This black bean soup recipe is easy and delicious.&nbsp;It calls for pantry ingredients like canned black beans and spices, and the cooking process is largely hands-off. The stove does most of the work for you! Even though it’s simple, this black bean soup has a bold, spicy flavor and creamy texture. The secret ingredient? Bean juice! See, when I cook with canned beans, I almost always start by draining and rinsing them. But in this black bean soup recipe, I use the liquid in the can as well as the beans themselves. This liquid, coupled with the fact that I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’re ever wondering how to spend a rainy, gray fall day, here’s your answer: make this butternut squash ravioli recipe! It’s a bit of a project, as you’ll make both the pasta and the filling from scratch, but Jack and I can attest that it’s a total blast. Your kitchen will fill with the mouthwatering aroma of roasting squash, shallots, and sage, and you’ll have a chance to get a little crafty as you carefully fill and punch out each piece of butternut squash ravioli. Then comes the best part: you eat! I love to serve my butternut squash…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’ve never cooked sautéed kale before, now’s the time to try it! It’s a versatile side dish, just as at home alongside a bowl of soup as it is next to a pile of pasta, but it’s also a fantastic cooking component. My recipe calls for 6 ingredients (3 of which are olive oil, salt, and pepper), and it cooks up in under 5 minutes. Because it’s so simple, it’s one of my go-to additions to clear-out-the-fridge frittatas, quick weeknight pastas, improvised grain bowls, and more. As an added bonus, it’s jam-packed with nutrients, and it tastes delicious. Kale…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you like pancakes that are light, fluffy, moist, and flavorful (who doesn’t?!), you’re going to LOVE these almond flour pancakes! I had the idea to make them last spring, when Jack and I were saving our limited supply of regular flour for baking projects like pita, bagels, and no-knead bread. All-purpose flour is easier to come by now, but in our house, these almond flour pancakes are sticking around for good. This almond flour pancake recipe is totally grain and gluten-free, but it’s just as good as any traditional pancake recipe I’ve tried. The pancakes are soft and tender,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mrJ2RqLyve8Wao6VnoJa0pnuScGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
