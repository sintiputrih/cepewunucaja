This typically involved vocal mixes or entire voice replacements, where a professional singer would take over for the lead actor behind the camera. The most notable examples include Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady (1964) and Natalie Wood in West Side Story (1961), both dubbed over by professional soprano Marni Nixon, often referred to as a “ghost singer.”</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>This practice still occurs in modern films, although in a slightly more nuanced way. While Rebecca Ferguson was fully dubbed over by professional opera singer Loren Allred in The Greatest Showman (2017), other film roles, such as Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) and Zac Efron in the first High School Musical movie (2005) used a mix of their own vocals with Freddie Mercury’s and Drew Seeley’s, respectively.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Often, movies still prioritize actors renowned for their previous work rather than professional singers. For example, La La Land (2016) received criticism for what some viewers perceived as lackluster vocal performances by actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, although the majority lauded both actors for their performances.</p><h2 id=h-did-john-travolta-sing-in-grease data-injectable=false>Did John Travolta sing in Grease?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Grease.jpeg><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>By the time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grease came around, John Travolta</a> was already a rising star, thanks to hit films like Carrie (1976) and Saturday Night Fever (1977), as well as his natural on-screen talent and charm. While the internet is rife with rumors that Travolta was lip-syncing in the musical movie, and understandably so, all vocals were provided by Mr. Danny Zuko himself. While not a professional singer, Travolta being well-fitted for the role helped sell the inherent cool of Danny, making up in magnetism where he may have lacked in singing abilities.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>In fact, the producers of Grease liked Travolta’s singing and swagger so much that, despite Danny not originally having the lead vocals in the song “Greased Lightning,” they gave them to the leading man anyway. “I wanted the number,” Travolta admitted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> in 2016, “and because I had clout, I could get the number.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KcXZ%2B8qbqMramarp%2BhwaJ50qKloGWZo3qovsSaqp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
