Currently, she is preparing to open the Vanderpump Cocktail Garden at the Forum Shops inside of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. LVP said that when she was asked to open a new restaurant in Vegas, it was the “ultimate compliment.” She explained that TomTom’s “brilliant design” from designer Nick Alain and her husband Ken is probably what scored her the invite to open a spot at Caesars Palace.</p><p>As she hires staff for the new business, one of the requirements is that “employees must be willing and able to appear on television or to be filmed while performing day to day job functions.”</p><p>So, does this mean that another Vanderpump series is on the way?</p><p>https://twitter.com/m_metcalf/status/1095468647143874560</p><p>“Oh, lordy! That would be, like, a hot mess traveling. Well, maybe. I mean, I’m sure some of the Vanderpump Rules cast would want to work out there… so, if we get picked up for another series, I’m sure some of it will filter over there, I’m not sure,” LVP told Entertainment Tonight.</p><p>&nbsp;Vanderpump says she hasn’t offered Vegas jobs to any of the SUR staff, but it could happen. The reality star says that Scheana Marie would be a good fit because she knows how to do a lot of things and has worked for her for a long time. Plus, Marie has been splitting her time recently between LA and Vegas.</p><p>As for the current season of Vanderpump Rules, LVP says that the cast definitely surprises her and has moments where she thinks “They did not do that!! Yes, they did.” She says things are like that because the friendships on the show are authentic and they spend a lot of time together, even when cameras aren’t rolling.</p><p>Vanderpump says that they could “actually film 24/7” because the cast is always together. She added that they don’t show their best moments – they show the worst.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BuAS4I6lm8S/</p><p>Then there is RHOBH, where <a href=#>Vanderpump is feuding with the cast</a> and currently involved in the #puppygate scandal. In an interview on Watch What Happens Live, she admitted that she thinks about leaving the show every day because she doesn’t need it. However, for now, Lisa Vanderpump is “still there.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>New episodes of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills air Tuesday nights on Bravo, and new episodes of Vanderpump Rules air Monday nights on the network.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeZqHqttdKaZK%2BZnpmys7zUpqdmn5Wpwaq6xmaYp6eknbKzedKpoKdln5uzbq3MoptmppWswG6%2Fx55koqtdobKiwsinnmaqmKSvqXnOr5yrZaCqvbHFxpqrnmViaYVxgI9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
