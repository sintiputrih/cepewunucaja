He is worshiped as the Geo archon, Rex Lapis of the Liyue region. He has then decided to retire governing Liyue for so long and wandered in the mortal realm as Zhongli, a Wangsheng Funeral's consultant.<h2>Are Rex lapis and Zhongli the same?</h2>Zhongli, Rex Lapis, and Morax are all names associated with this man, but Morax is the one most known to the people of Liyue. In fact, Liyue named Teyvat's currency mora after their preferred name for Zhongli.<h2>Is Zhongli Geo Archon?</h2>Zhongli is the geo archon and former protector of Liyue. Previously known by Morax and Rex Lapis, he is one of the most important characters in the lore and a fan favorite.<h2>Is Rex Lapis the strongest Archon?</h2>When Ei acheived power , her strict policies increased her power tenfold . But the respect and devotion the people of Liyue have towards Rex Lapis still overlapped her power thus making Zhongli the strongest Archon .<h2>Zhongli Reveals He's Rex Lapis (Geo Archon) And His Plan | All Cutsenes/Dialogue</h2><p></p><h2>Who is the second strongest Archon?</h2><p>In this fantasy world, each of the seven regions is led by one of the seven Archons.<br>...<br>Genshin Impact: 7 Strongest Characters Based On Lore</p><li>1 Zhongli.</li><li>2 Raiden Ei. ...</li><li>3 Venti. ...</li><li>4 Xiao. ...</li><li>5 Alice. ...</li><li>6 Dainsleif. ...</li><li>7 Tartaglia. ...</li><h2>Who is the youngest Archon?</h2>The youngest Archon is the one from Sumeru, who is only 500 years old. It should be noted that not all of the original seven Archons are still around, as the Archon War took place over 2000 years ago.<h2>Who is the cryo Archon?</h2>The Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya, also known as the Cryo Archon, is one of the three main antagonists in the 2020 action role-playing fantasy video game Genshin Impact (alongside the Traveler's twin and Unknown God).<h2>Is Zhongli The Lord of Geo?</h2>Zhongli, a 5-star character, is a consultant for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. But more importantly, he is the Geo Archon; Zhongli is the vessel for Morax (the God of Contracts and Rex Lapis).<h2>Does Xiao know that Zhongli is Rex Lapis?</h2>It is implied that Xiao knows of Rex Lapis' mortal form with evidence from his voiceline "About Zhongli", referring to Zhongli as 'Zhongli-daren' and 'Zhongli-sama' in the Chinese voice and Japanese dub respectively.<h2>Who is the oldest Archon Genshin?</h2>Liyue's Morax, the God of Contracts, is the oldest Archon in Genshin Impact, with at least over 2000 years under his rule.<h2>Who is the Dendro Archon?</h2>The Dendro Archon is the Archon who presides over Sumeru, the land of Dendro. At least two holders of this title are known: The previous Dendro Archon (possibly the God of the Woods), who died during the cataclysm 500 years ago. Lesser Lord Kusanali, the current Dendro Archon.<h2>What was Zhongli before he became an Archon?</h2>At the time, Zhongli was the co-ruler of the prosperous Guili Assembly alongside the God of Dust, Guizhong. During a certain battle, despite their efforts and the aid of the adepti, Guizhong was slain and the Guili Assembly was destroyed. Sometime afterwards, 3700 years ago, Zhongli moved his people south of Mt.<h2>Is Rex Lapis an adepti?</h2>The adepti (singular adeptus) (Chinese: 仙 Xiān) are a group in Liyue that consists of both illuminated beasts and gods. Most of them are bound by a contract to protect Liyue from demons and evil gods and are led by the Prime of Adepti, Rex Lapis himself.<h2>Is Dendro an Archon male?</h2>The Dendro Archon was actually a woman all along. The reason this mistake happened is there are no gendered pronouns in Chinese. So the Chinese original dialogue of Genshin Impact until now didn't refer to the Dendro Archon as either she or he. Until Yae Miko confirmed she is female.<h2>Why is Zhongli called Rex lapis and Morax?</h2>While Morax is the original name of the God of Contracts, he is known throughout the story by another. Rex Lapis is the name used by the vast majority of Morax's followers, meant to show great respect. Consequently, Morax has become an insult against the god throughout the story.<h2>Is Paimon a dude?</h2>What's the gender of Paimon? Paimon is a female NPC in Genshin Impact that follows you around and will act as your guide for the continent of Teyvat. She enters the story as a character saved by you from a lake that she was about to drown in.<h2>Who is the hydro Archon?</h2>The Hydro Archon is the Archon who presides over Fontaine, the land of Hydro.

They eventually emerged victorious, taking down the archon and freeing the people from his stormy cage.<h2>Is Tsaritsa the Archon of love?</h2>The Tsaritsa<p>She is the God of Love. It is directly stated here that the Tsaritsa is planning to have a rebellion against the divine being, the same being that the God of Justice is afraid of.</p><h2>Is Paimon the Unknown God?</h2>Genshin Impact: Is Paimon the unknown God? Paimon is not the unknown god. The picture came to light when some users posted a picture of Paimon, claiming her to be the unknown god challenging the main character/ Lumine in a boss fight.<h2>Who was the Cryo Archon before Tsaritsa?</h2>From what we know so far, the Tsaritsa is the Cryo Archon presiding over Snezhnaya. If you're not familiar with Snezhnaya, it's the land where Fatui come from. One of the most notable Fatui personalities you may be familiar with is Tartaglia A.K.A.
