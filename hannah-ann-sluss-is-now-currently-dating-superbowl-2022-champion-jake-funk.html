The couple had plenty to celebrate after the Los Angeles Rams won the 2022 NFL championship with a 23-20 victory.</p><h2>How old Is Hannah Ann Sluss?</h2><p>The Bachelor reality show contestant is 25 years old. Her meteoric rise began in 2014 when she competed in the Miss Tennessee pageant. She continued to compete in pageants in the following years, finishing as the second runner-up in 2015. In 2017, she came in fourth place, and in 2018, she was named the pageant’s first runner-up.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hannah-Ann-Sluss-2.jpg alt="Hannah Ann Sluss" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following her pageant experience, she started sharing images of herself on Instagram, establishing a modeling career. She was named the September 2016 cover girl of JVN Magazine. Sluss competed on The Bachelor’s 24th season, vying for Peter Weber’s love. Even though Weber proposed to her at the season finale, the two parted soon after shooting. Weber described his breakup with Sluss as “tough,” citing the following reasons:</p><p>“Hannah Ann is the loveliest person you’ll ever meet; nothing about her is phony.” … It’s 100 percent real, that is her. Knowing I was going to injure her completely tore me up, and I wasn’t OK for a time after that, but it’s all in the past now, and we’re moving ahead.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hannah-Ann-Sluss-3.jpg alt="Hannah Ann Sluss" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Along with being a reality star and a beauty pageant participant, she also starred in Chris Lane’s music video for “I Don’t Know About You.”&nbsp;She also has her own YouTube account, where she started producing videos four months ago.
