Not from his work in movies like Pulp Fiction, but as a parent whose son also played basketball. Their son’s respective high schools had previously squared off in a game.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjk4uopsr002a3i60w3iecjnh@published data-word-count=100>The incident scared Rhames, not just for his own safety, but for that of his child. “What if it was my son and he had a video game remote or something, and you thought it was a gun,” he mused. “Just like, I don’t know, Trayvon had a bag of Skittles.” According to police, Rhames says, a neighbor had called 911 to report a “large black man” breaking into the actor’s home. When police escorted Rhames to the neighbor’s house to clear things up, she denied placing the call.
