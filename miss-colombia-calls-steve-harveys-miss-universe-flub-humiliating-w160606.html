The <i>Family Feud</i> host, 58, cleared up his mistake after Gutierrez had already waved to the crowd and received flowers. The real victor, Miss Philippines’&nbsp;<b>Pia Wurtzbach</b>, was just as shocked by the mix-up.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Gutierrez, meanwhile, teared up when she learned of her runner-up title. She explained to W radio that she thought Harvey was just kidding because he joked around during rehearsals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/steve-harvey-2-4729d58d-d55c-4afb-a90f-6b85de227acf.jpg><p><span>Harvey’s brutal blunder quickly </span><a href=#>went viral via social media.</a><span> Several memes were created, and some viewers even thought that the mistake was just a ratings ploy. “If that was the goal, they succeeded,” Gutierrez said.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p>Furthermore, others — <a href=#>including <b>Donald Trump</b></a><b></b> — believed that both Gutierrez and Wurtzbach should have been named co-winners. (The GOP candidate, 69, tweeted his opinion after the live show. Trump was fired from NBC and the Miss USA pageant in June following his controversial comments about Mexican immigrants.)</p><p>“For the first time, I agree with him,” Gutierrez told W radio of the former <i>Celebrity Apprentice </i>host.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/miss-columbia-universe-3387a715-fdf3-4133-b461-cce3d1b7b7c6.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoaOoeqS7y6ikm6GRYrCiuMusZKyslauybrTAq62esaNiuqq%2F0masp6Gmmr%2B0sYyfo66aXZ3CrrXLopitoZ6cerh9lWltaW5f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
