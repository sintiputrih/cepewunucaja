For Harper's BAZAAR's September 2022 cover story, the Oscar-nominated actress opens up about the media storm that descended upon Don't Worry Darling after Styles was cast in the fall of 2020 and, later, when he and Wilde went public with their relationship in January 2021."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When the official trailer dropped back in May, the Internet predictably hyper-focused on a teased sex scene between Pugh and Styles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When it's reduced to your sex scenes, or to watch the most famous man in the world go down on someone, it's not why we do it. It's not why I'm in this industry," Pugh tells BAZAAR. "Obviously, the nature of hiring the most famous pop star in the world, you're going to have conversations like that. That's just not what I'm going to be discussing because [this movie is] bigger and better than that. And the people who made it are bigger and better than that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pugh also expresses her gratitude for the crew and team of nurses who helped keep everyone on set safe amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. "If I shout about one thing, it's that these people made that movie happen. They came to work every day on time and fully respected the process," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Don't Worry Darling will be released in theaters on September 23.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
