Although he has been silent regarding his comeback from the long hiatus, the pro‚Äôs accolades that came as a result of his insane skills on the course continue to dazzle the sporting world, to say the least. But even so, is his skills the only thing that helped him on the greens?</p><p>Well, it doesn‚Äôt come off as a surprise when we credit the huge amount of hard work put in by the Hall of Famer for the achievements in the sport. However, what might come off as an eye-opener would be the attention to detail that the GOAT employs on the course during his performance, using an ultimate weapon of sorts! Curious much?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Tiger Woods and his usage of different tees</h2><p>Woods has been known to employ a variety of techniques during his gameplay including the ‚ÄúStop at the top drill‚Äù&nbsp;which would <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>help in driving the ball farther</a>. However, a resurfaced story has brought another such strategy to the fore, once again. And this time, it‚Äôs about the PGA Tour pro using different tees for different instances.</p><p>Woods‚Äô caddie during the 2022 PNC Championship was none other than Joe LaCava. And, the 15X major winner was playing with his son Charlie Woods during the same.&nbsp; The looper, once, recounted a memory during the event at the 13th hole of the course where the professional picked out his tee, took a look at it, and then turned to LaCava to ask for a longer one.</p><p>Well, the longer stand did turn out to be effective as the ball was sent flying into the air coming to land just left of the green to set up an easy 10th birdie for the Woods team on the second day. While reminiscing, the looper was quick to point out how ‚Äòcomplacency‚Äô was off the list for the 82X PGA Tour champ. Moreover, he also alluded to how the legend always looks at the details while learning to take advantage of even a small area that no one would ever think of.</p><p>As it turns out, the golfer keeps two different tees, a standard 2.1-inch one, and a longer 3.3-inch stand to drive the balls. It does pique one‚Äôs interest to find out the difference in using the two.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-golf-news-pga-tour-from-tiger-woods-viral-mugshot-to-a-hilarious-olympic-portrait-here-are-the-top-five-infamous-photos-of-popular-golfers-donald-trump-john-daly-xander-schauffele-rory-mcilroy?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-07-12T110326Z_744069443_UP1EI7C0UPOM3_RTRMADP_3_GOLF-OPEN-425x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">From Tiger Woods‚Äô Viral Mugshot to a Hilarious Olympic Portrait, Here Are the Top 5 Infamous Photos of Popular Golfers</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Why does Woods use the different tees?</h2><p>Continuing on his account, the looper mentioned how he kept a close eye on the rest of the 2019 Masters Tournament winner. For the shorter and standard tee, the golfer hit a slight cut allowing him more spin on the holes which can have trouble on both sides.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tiger‚Äôs stinger drive vs. Tiger‚Äôs high ‚Äúbomb‚Äù drive, overlayed</p><p>101ft difference in apex.

The driver goes a bit higher into the air than the usual allowing Woods to squeeze a bit extra from the shot. And, this is what the legend calls the&nbsp;‚Äúhigh bomb‚Äù&nbsp;drive.</p><p>The small techniques that the Hall of Famer used have undoubtedly led to him becoming one of the best long-game players in the history of golf. One can hope that Woods reaches the peak of his game as soon as possible when he comes back from his long hiatus owing to his recovery.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story | <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Tiger Woods vs Phil Mickelson Head-to-Head Record: Who Leads the Epic Rivalry</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8aoo59lnprEtHnPoJhmrJ%2Bqv27Dx6KjnmWknrSmvoywpqico2K%2FprnAoqWsZZSarqV50qKjnqakYq6ju9StZKGho2KwsLnEm5ico12dtrR51KWroqWRqbJuw8Sap6imo2LAtbvRsmSfoZ6ZwG6tzWaYrpyZmruksYyanpqhnmLBprGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
