I don’t think that I had an amazing relationship to my queerness, but through playing Leighton, I feel like I’m being much more openly queer, because it is a public part of who I am, and I’m very proud of that.”</p><p>When asked how she would prefer to identify her sexuality in a November 2021 interview with <a href=#>Vulture</a>, Reneé replied with, “I usually just use the term queer. I’m 21, and there will be days that I go to my partner and be like, ‘We need to have a conversation because I think I’m this.’ And then I’ll come back and be like, ‘No, I’m this.’ It’s a queer, evolving story.”</p><p>Reneé noted in the same interview that she was grateful to be a part of a generation that has, “More grace about finding your identity and how these things change and loving that part of yourself.”</p><h2>Who Has Reneé Rapp Dated?</h2><p>She was linked to fellow Broadway star <a href=#><strong>Antonio Cipriano </strong></a>in&nbsp;2019, according to <a href=#>Broadway.com</a>.
