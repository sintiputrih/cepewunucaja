According to his Empire co-star Taraji P. Henson, Smollett will absolutely be returning to the show should Fox renew it for a sixth season. “I haven’t heard anything else,” Henson said on <a href=#>The View</a>. “I haven’t heard anything.” She also insisted that she talks to Smollett “all the time,” and he’s remained in a positive mindset after <a href=#>all of his very public court appearances</a>. “We’re all doing well. The show is doing well,” Henson added. “We’re on hiatus right now. The writers are trying to figure out what the next season is gonna look like — what our story line is gonna be. They’re trying to drum up some really good juicy stuff for you guys, so that’s where we are right now.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju5sw03s002y3g66b7felmao@published data-word-count=125>Prior to Smollett’s charges being dropped, <a href=#>it was reported</a> that Empire was strongly considering recasting his lead character, Jamal Lyon. Lee Daniels, the show’s co-creator, was apparently “a strong proponent of the recast option.” Even after his victory in court, there were <a href=#>subsequent reports</a> that suggested Smollett — who’s been laying low since the reversal — would never return to the show given his unusual legal circumstances. “I’ve been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,” he said during a courtroom press conference <a href=#>at the time</a>. “I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of what I’ve been accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time, honestly, one of the worst of my entire life.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwih7bke00193h666j0lljq0@published data-word-count=62><strong>Update: </strong>Contrary to prior reports, Empire creator Lee Daniels confirmed today that Jussie Smollett will actually not be returning to the show for its sixth and final season. Daniels responded <a href=#>via Twitter </a>directly to a Variety report saying that writers were “prepping for Smollett’s return, calling the information <a href=#>“inaccurate.”</a> So it looks like audiences really have seen the last of Jamal Lyon.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjseu0yk40095oqy6547ts8ii@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline></span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Jussie Smollett Will Not Return To Empire After All</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocmdga3yrwdKsoJ5lo6K8rbjEratmr5mhuW66zq1kq52kqr%2BvedOoZJ%2BnqKh6prnPoqmeZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
