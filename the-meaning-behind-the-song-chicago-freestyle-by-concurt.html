Concurt brings a moody R&B vibe to this track and sets the tone for his upcoming album.</p><p>“My entire album is all R&B, I feel the game needs this right now,” said Concurt. He is excited to release all this new content to the fans and believes that R&B music can bring something unique and refreshing to the industry.</p><p>“Chicago Freestyle” originally performed by Drake, featuring GIVĒON, is the foundation for Concurt’s remix. He takes this song and adds his own personal touch, creating a new version that showcases his own style and interpretation.</p><p>Now, let’s dive deeper into the meaning behind Concurt’s rendition of “Chicago Freestyle.”</p><p>The lyrics of the song convey a sense of longing and desire. In the chorus, Giveon sings, “Two thirty baby, won’t you meet me by The Bean? Too early, maybe later you can show me things.” This line suggests a rendezvous in Chicago, where the iconic Bean sculpture serves as a meeting place. The lyrics evoke a sense of anticipation and excitement about exploring the city and experiencing new things together.</p><p>In the first verse, Concurt adds his own lyrics, “Ride on me, girl. Vibe with me, yuh. Can’t you see, yuh? Windy City.” These lines further emphasize the idea of embracing the atmosphere and energy of Chicago, known as the Windy City. Concurt invites the listener to join him on this journey and indulge in the richness of the city.</p><p>The following lines, “When I’m low, hold me close. Things you don’t know, don’t tell a soul,” convey a sense of vulnerability and trust. Concurt opens up about his emotions and seeks solace in the company of someone he trusts. He values confidentiality and the deep connection that comes with shared secrets and intimate experiences.</p><p>The chorus repeats, emphasizing the desire for physical and emotional closeness despite the chilly weather. The line “Windy City, she blowing me kisses” metaphorically describes the city’s cold wind as tender and affectionate gestures.</p><p>Interpreting the meaning behind a song can be subjective, as it often depends on the personal experiences and emotions of the listener. For me, “Chicago Freestyle” represents a yearning for connection and exploration. It speaks to the desire to experience a city’s vibrancy and to connect deeply with another person in that environment.</p><p>I remember listening to this song for the first time while on a road trip to Chicago. The lyrics resonated with me as I gazed at the city skyline and felt the energy of the city. The song became a soundtrack to that moment, capturing the excitement and anticipation I felt as I explored the Windy City.</p><p>Overall, Concurt’s remix of “Chicago Freestyle” offers a fresh take on the original song by Drake. It brings a moody R&B vibe and invites listeners to embrace the ambiance of Chicago. The lyrics convey a longing for connection and the desire to experience new things. Whether you’ve been to Chicago or not, this song can transport you to a place of longing and anticipation.</p><p>As Concurt continues to release new content and his upcoming album, it is clear that R&B music is his passion, and he aims to bring something unique and refreshing to the industry. “Chicago Freestyle” is just a taste of what’s to come, and I am eagerly awaiting the release of Concurt’s full album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBpaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmaaoaGTlrSwecWrnJ6rpK65pnnBsmScp56YwrPAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
