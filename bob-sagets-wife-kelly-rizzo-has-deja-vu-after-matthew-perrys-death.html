The Los Angeles coroner’s office later confirmed his death at age 54. An <a href=#>initial autopsy</a> was performed, but the results were inconclusive pending a toxicology report.</p><p>Perry’s family <a href=#>addressed his death</a> in a statement on Sunday, October 29. He is survived by his parents, <strong>John Bennett Perry</strong> and <strong>Suzanne Morrison</strong>, who split when he was an infant. His mother later remarried, exchanging vows with Dateline host <strong>Keith Morrison</strong>.</p><p>“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother,” the family’s statement read. “Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend. You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bob-Saget-s-Wife-Kelly-Rizzo-Has-Deja-Vu-After-Matthew-Perry-s-Death-inline.png><p>Saget, meanwhile, died on January 9, 2022, at age 65. He was <a href=#>found in his hotel room</a> in Orlando, Florida, where he performed a stand-up show one night prior. His family confirmed in a <a href=#>February 2022 statement</a> to Us Weekly that Saget “passed from head trauma.”</p><p>“As we continue to mourn together, we ask everyone to remember the love and laughter that Bob brought to this world, and the lessons he taught us all: to be kind to everyone, to let the people you love know you love them, and to face difficult times with hugs and laughter,” the statement continued.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since her husband’s death, Rizzo has been candid about her grief. The twosome tied the knot in 2018. (Saget previously welcomed <a href=#>daughters Aubrey, Lara and Jennifer</a> with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Sherri Kramer</strong></a>.)</p><p>Rizzo shared a powerful message with fans while marking <a href=#>her first holiday season</a> without Saget in December 2022. “Cherish every single moment. I certainly didn’t think that our first Christmas together (in the same city) last year would be our last. … The holidays are a time for hope, love, and togetherness. I pray that if you’re missing a loved one this holiday season, that you’re blessed with many deep and loving memories and gratitude that will help carry you through,” she wrote via Instagram at the time alongside a photo of herself and the late Full House alum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5JiwKKzxK2qZq%2BZm7Jut8Slo7Jlop7Hu7uMoZisZZSat6J51a5kmp6kmr9uucCtq6Gdp2K9pr7RsqpmnJWWwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
