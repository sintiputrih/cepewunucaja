Swift, 34, attended boyfriend Travis Kelce’s AFC Wild Card game against the Miami Dolphins on Saturday, January 13, wearing a red puffer jacket made out of his Chiefs jersey.
The look was made by designer Kristin Juszczyk, the wife of San Francisco 49ers athlete Kyle Juszczyk, who has made similar looks for other partners of NFL pros."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m like, ‘OK, how can I reinvent the jersey and make it so people can represent their favorite player in cold weather?’”</p><p class=p1>Swift’s jersey featured cut-up Kelce #87 Nike jerseys sewn onto a puffer jacket, which helped the Grammy winner stay warm considering Saturday’s record-low winter temperatures.</p><p class=p1>Kristin had previously designed a pair of custom pants for <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong>, the wife of Chiefs quarterback <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>, to wear for a regular season game in 2023. She later sent Brittany, 28, a jersey puffer coat for the Saturday game. Kristin told KRON4 News that <a href=#>she decided to “shoot her shot”</a> and send a Kelce version for Swift at the same time.</p><p class=p1>“An honor of a lifetime!!!!! Thank you @taylorswift & @brittanylynne <span class=s1>❤️❤️❤️❤️</span>,” Kristin later wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, sharing footage of her creation.</p><p class=p1>Kristin has also designed a similar puffer coat for<strong> Simone Biles</strong>, who is married to Green Bay Packers safety <strong>Jonathan Owens</strong>, and herself. Kristin’s version, which she shared on <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> earlier this month, features Kyle’s #44 jersey number on the coat’s front, back and sleeves. All of his football stats were stitched on the side.</p><p class=p1>Kyle, 32, and Kristin have been married since 2019 and he is the No. 1 cheerleader of her sewing enterprise.</p><p class=p1>“She’s an absolute star!” Kyle gushed on Saturday, reposting footage of Swift’s jacket onto his X (formerly Twitter) page. “Jacket goes crazy.”</p><p class=p1>Swift, for her part, <a href=#>has been dating</a> Chiefs tight end Kelce, 34, since summer 2023. They took their romance public when she attended her first Chiefs game in September 2023. Since then, Swift has become a staple in the stands, often wearing trendy team merch.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I wasn’t even thinking about it. [49ers defensive lineman] <strong>Nick Bosa</strong> [was] calling me in 10 minutes so I can take notes for the 49ers – Browns game … [Then, a video] scrolls up on my Instagram [of Taylor],” <strong>Erin Andrews</strong> said <a href=#>on her “Calm Down” podcast</a> of seeing Swift sport her WEAR windbreaker to an October 2023 game. “And she’s so cute walking in with her little skirt and boots … and her cute little top and her red lipstick — which I want to start wearing, but I know I can’t — and then I was like, ‘Wait wait, is that? Is that? I don’t know!’”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “Long story short, we finally confirm, we finally see it, we finally figure it out. I’m screaming my brains out. Nick Bosa calls me and he’s like, ‘Hey Erin, how are you?’ and I said, ‘You know, Nick, when Taylor Swift shows up to the Thursday night game in your windbreaker, you’re great.’ I mean, I couldn’t be better, how are you and your defense?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6muurjOq2Ssr5mbwW7DxJqprGWTqsC1u8xmq6uZpp7AbrfEpZqeZaCqs6ex0WaaqJmkYsGwecKhoJ6eo2K0ornEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
