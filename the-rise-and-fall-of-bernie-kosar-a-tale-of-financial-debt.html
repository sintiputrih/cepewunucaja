From a successful career on the field to facing financial hardships and personal struggles, Kosar's story is one of triumphs, trials, and tribulations.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Financial Downfall</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Bankruptcy and Property Loss</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Following the 2008–2009 recession, Kosar and his businesses declared bankruptcy on June 19, 2009. This move revealed a staggering $9.2 million in assets and a substantial $18.9 million in debt. The bankruptcy filing initially aimed for a Chapter 11 restructuring, but it was later converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Ft. Lauderdale on January 6, 2010. This transition raised questions about the protection of Kosar's NFL pension under the Chapter 7 proceeding.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Additionally, in July 2010, reports surfaced that Kosar was at risk of losing property in Geauga County, Ohio due to unpaid back taxes amounting to $173,557.90. The situation became more precarious when the trustees of Auburn Township considered purchasing the land in foreclosure in September 2010.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Business Ventures</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite these financial setbacks, Kosar continued to explore business opportunities. Notably, he lent his name to Kosar's Wood-Fired Grill at the Hard Rock Rock Casino Northfield Park in Northfield, Ohio, which opened in December 2013. Furthermore, he collaborated with Ohio grocery chain Heinen's for a motivational and wellness seminar series based on his autobiography, 'Learning to Scramble,' published in 2017.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Personal Life and Beyond</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Marital and Personal Challenges</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kosar's personal life also faced its share of turbulence. His marriage to Babette Ferre in 1990 ended in divorce in 2007, with allegations of reckless spending, bad investments, and drug use. Following this, Kosar dated Tami Longaberger of The Longaberger Company from 2009 to 2013.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Health Issues and Legal Troubles</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to financial and personal challenges, Kosar grappled with health issues stemming from multiple concussions sustained during his playing career. These health concerns led him to enroll in an experimental treatment program to alleviate his symptoms, which he has since advocated for among fellow players.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Furthermore, in 2013, Kosar faced legal trouble when he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. This incident culminated in a plea of no contest to a lesser charge of reckless operation, resulting in a fine and a suspended jail sentence.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Political Involvement</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kosar's political inclinations have been a topic of interest. While his political views remain ambiguous, he was invited to the 2016 Republican National Convention and spoke positively of Ohio and Cleveland. Notably, in 2022, he appeared in an advertisement for Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in Ohio.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>A Story of Resilience and Transformation</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Bernie Kosar's journey is a testament to the highs and lows that life can bring, even for a revered sports figure.
