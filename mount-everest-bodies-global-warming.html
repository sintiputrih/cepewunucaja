I myself have retrieved around 10 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dead bodies</a> in recent years from different locations on Everest and clearly more and more of them are emerging now.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Dead Climber On Everest" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dead-climber-on-everest.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>NNMGA treasurer Tenzeeng Sherpa strongly agreed with this assessment, that global warming is causing glaciers to melt faster than ever, even by one entire meter per year.</p><p>“Most of the dead bodies we bring to the towns, but those we can’t bring down we respect by saying prayers for them and covering them with rock or snow,” he said. “We have not seen the government taking any responsibility.”</p><p>In 1953, Edmund Hillary and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenzing Norgay</a> scaled Everest’s summit for the first time. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">More than 4,000 people have followed</a> since then, but unfortunately, not all of them made it back down. Recovering those bodies is not only difficult, but expensive and deadly.</p><p>For Tshering Sherpa — one of the very first students at a mountaineering school built by Hillary — said that one of the most perilous recoveries ever accomplished took place near the peak, at 8,700 meters.</p><p>“The body weighed 150kg and it had to be recovered from a difficult place at that altitude,” said Tshering. “It was a Herculean task.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, removing a dead body can cost up to $80,000 — not a frivolous affair — and though Nepalese law requires government agencies to be involved in these removals, things often get done without their help.</p><p>It can take quite a while for sherpas like Tshering to garner the necessary funding from the government to engage in these hazardous removals. However, he explained that his community often does so regardless of expenses and that there’s a moral responsibility at heart.</p><p>“We, the operators, feel it is our duty and so whenever we find them, we bring the bodies down,” he said.</p><p>Next up, read about the final hours of <a href=#>Francys Arsentiev — Mount Everest’s “Sleeping Beauty.”</a> Then, see <a href=#>the moment hikers discovered George Mallory’s body</a> on Mount Everest and learn the story of how mountaineer <a href=#>Ueli Steck</a> perished ascending the mountain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuu9Snq2adppq%2Fpr%2FTZpmonJmawG6zy6iZmqRdrK6zucinng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
