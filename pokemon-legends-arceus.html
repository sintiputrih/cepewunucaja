The first one is to enable autosaves, which we’ll cover in more detail in the next section. The second is to use manual saving, which will probably be one of your best friends in the game. If you need to save your progress manually, press Up on the d-pad and then scroll to the save screen by pressing ZL or ZR. It’s pretty simple from there; I think you can handle it on your own.</p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; }<h2>Autosaving in Pokemon Legends Arceus Explained</h2><p>Autosaving in Pokemon Legends Arceus is fairly simple. First off, you need to make sure that it’s enabled. Just go into the Help screen and select “Settings.” In the Settings menu and scroll down until you find “Autosave,” then flip the “switch” to “enabled.” That’s all there is to it. From then on, every time the game makes an autosave, you’ll see a little “Now saving” message in the top right corner. When the words disappear, the saving process is over. This happens in several different situations, such as leaving buildings and the like.</p><h2>Does Pokemon Legends Arceus Support Cloud Saving</h2><p>To the best of our knowledge, Legends Arceus does not support cloud saving. I don’t think there’s been a single Pokemon game that does. Apparently, this is to prevent potential hacks and Pokemon duplication and whatnot. Maybe that’s going to change; maybe the developers will add cloud saves somewhere down the line. We’re going to update the guide if that does end up being the case.</p><h2>Can You Have Multiple Save Files in Pokemon Legends Arceus</h2><p>No; as far as we can tell, you can’t have multiple save files in Pokemon Legends Arceus. If you want to start a new adventure, you’ll have to delete your current save. It’s not exactly the optimal situation to be in, but what can you do. We might be wrong about this, and we’ll be sure to update the guide if that’s the case. For know, however, we’re fairly certain you can only have one save file.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jqmmpJ2dpLtuuMSgnKeco2Kus6%2FErqpooJ%2BserW7jKyYr51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
