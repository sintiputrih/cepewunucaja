After it was revealed that he was questioning the paternity of Lyrica’s son Ocean, A1 got angry and attempted to slap the messiness right out of him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That’s not the first time Misster Ray has been slapped up on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. It was only a couple of seasons back that he and Zell Swag were on the outs. There were even reports that Zell got fired from the show after he attacked Misster Ray at the LHHH reunion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That beef obviously got squashed, and both men are back on the VH1 series, causing drama again. And that has many wondering where Misster Ray came from.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As it turns out, Misster Ray’s real name is Raymond Cunningham, and he’s done a few projects beyond his stint on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. Originally from Richmond, Virginia, the 36-year-old is now listed as an actor and an executive on IMDb.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some of Misster Ray’s most notable credits include a voice role in Grand Theft Auto V. He also played Armond Dupree in the television series Friends & Lovers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Misster Ray also has his hands in a few businesses, including the game Yardopoly, which he founded. He also previously contributed to Bleu Magazine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now that Misster Ray has found conflict with another member of the Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood cast, we can probably expect to see more of him. And with the reunion show on the horizon, we can’t help but wonder if it’ll be a repeat of the drama from the last one he was a part of.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood airs Mondays at 8/7c on VH1.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWivmKR6qr%2BMpqCsq6Sav26%2BwLJkqKZdoby3sYyhoKllmKS9brTOpaOyr5%2BksXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
