For <a href=#>Netflix</a>‚Äôs reality dating show <a href=#><u>Too Hot to Handle</u></a>, the group of singles is led by a snarky narrator they don't get to hear and an AI type of device called Lana. And, surprisingly, Lana is who some fans are curious about the most.</p><p>She keeps the contestants (mostly) celibate and readily calls them out for getting too fresh with each other, thereby causing the prize money to gradually dwindle down. In case you've been out of the loop, the <a href=#>Season 5 cast</a> already broke the rules on eight occasions in just four episodes!</p><p>Lana is also there to help them see the value in dating each other to get to a deeper connection than just the physical side of things. And, according to the show‚Äôs creators, she is more than just Netflix‚Äôs very own Alexa.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who voices Lana on 'Too Hot to Handle'?</h2><p>Lana isn't credited on IMDb for the series, which makes sense, given who the voice behind the Netflix-created AI probably is. While no one from the show has come out to explain who voices Lana, that‚Äôs probably because she is likely voiced by a team of producers.</p><p>Capital FM reports that producers come up with a script for Lana, which is then recited back to the contestants <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>through a digital voice</u></a>. If it‚Äôs true, then it's not unlike the system in place for one of Netflix's other reality shows, The Circle.</p><p>Creator Tim Harcourt told Vulture that there‚Äôs a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>control room of producers</u></a> who take down what contestants say and dictate it for The Circle. So it's definitely not out of the realm of possibilities for a similar technology to be behind Lana.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This dude Dre really shedding tears at the too hot to handle Lana revealüò≠üò≠üò≠ like bro is it that deep??? <a href=#>#THTH</a> <a href=#>#toohottohandle</a></p>‚Äî Madame Meena (@madame_meena) <a href=#>July 15, 2023</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôm trying to understand why the contestants on too hot to handle lie when they already know Lana is gonna say what they did ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>‚Äî betty broderick (@joellalexi) <a href=#>July 16, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lana is supposed to be 'Too Hot to Handle's' take on Amazon's Alexa.</h2><p>Not surprisingly, Lana is basically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Too Hot to Handle</u><u>‚Äôs take on an Amazon Alexa</u></a> device. In this digital age, where so many households have an Alexa to aid them in grocery shopping and even entertaining, it makes sense for the young singles on Too Hot to Handle to be guided by a similar device in all aspects of their romances.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a></figure><p>Too Hot to Handle creator Louise Peet told Oprah Magazine (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a>) in 2020 that Lana was meant to be there for the contestants while being the eyes and ears for producers at the same time.</p><p>"We think of Lana as Mary Poppins meets Ellen DeGeneres," Louise said. "She's also a bit of a super nanny as well." She added that Lana was meant to guide contestants as well as scold them and that for the contestants, "Lana was their love guru, Lana was their guidance, Lana was their friend."</p><p>Lana is really just what would happen if your Google Home could judge you every day (a terrifying thought, really).</p><p>You can enjoy Lana's celibacy policing on Season 5 of Too Hot to Handle, now streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa6vrYytpqhlmKTBbsDOZp%2BappShsg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
