Despite the cursed bloodline running through his veins, Jin seeks to destroy the devil’s heritage. He will join forces with his uncle Lars Alexandersson and devise a plan to take out his father Kazuya Mishima, the other bearer of the devil gene.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2.

He defeated Jin in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5, moments before Jin transformed into his devil form and almost killed him. The conflict between The Resistance and Zaibatsu occupied Tekken 6 and in the following events in Tekken 7, Devil Jin was defeated by Hwoarang in the Middle East, forcing the latter to return to his human form. Tekken 8 will hopefully conclude the long-standing rivalry between the two.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5.

She formerly served as the leader of Mishima Zaibatsu’s “Tekken Force” special forces unit, and will now join Kazuya’s side to serve as the commander of the G Corporation soldiers following the G Corp domination.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9.

Will she finally win over Asuka after getting defeated by her twice?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>11. Asuka Kazama: Spirited Peacemaker</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false><strong>Fighting Style: </strong>Kazama-Style Traditional Martial Arts</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>Asuka Kazama was first introduced in Tekken 5 and has returned for every following entry in the series. She defeated the young heiress Lili at The King of Iron Fist Tournament twice, but their rivalry continues. Tekken 8 might see her facing off against Lili and her relative Jin, whom she blames for the worldwide conflict.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>12. Leroy Smith: Grandmaster of Drip</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=25 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false><strong>Fighting Style</strong>: Wing Chun</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Leroy Smith made his debut in Tekken 7 as a Wing Chun master from New York, who wanted to take down the Mishima Zaibatsu for destroying his city.

He enters every King of the Iron Fist tournament in hopes of proving himself as the best fighter in the entire universe but has never won the tournament. Last, on Tekken 7, the tournament was suspended with the disappearance of Mishima Zaibatsu, but Paul will be back for some more fights in Tekken 8. Maybe it’s time for the Paul-Kazuya rivalry to continue!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>14. Marshall Law: The Legendary Dragon</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false><strong>Fighting Style: </strong>Martial Arts / Jeet Kune Do</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Marshall Law debuted in the original Tekken game and has been a part of every subsequent game except Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag Tournament.

Now poverty-stricken and in debt, he will return to Tekken 8 and team up with Paul to win the money.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>15. King: Anger of the Beast</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false><strong>Fighting Style:</strong> Professional Wrestling</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=745 data-injectable=true>The beloved luchador from Mexico and savior of orphans, King will be a playable character in Tekken 8, continuing the ritual of a King appearance in every Tekken game. The number of children in need of his assistance has increased dramatically as a result of the world-devastating conflict between the G Corp and Mishima Zaibatsu. He will continue to compete in Tekken 8 and earn money to help more orphans.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>16. Bryan Fury: Harbinger of Chaos</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false><strong>Fighting Style:</strong> Kickboxing</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>Byran Fury, a former cop turned psychotic cyborg will continue to wreak havoc in Tekken 8. He first appeared in Tekken 3 and has been a part of the game series ever since. Bryan returned to combat zones after the sixth tournament was canceled and went on indiscriminate rampages there. In Tekken 7, Byran found himself in a conflict zone in the U.S.A. where the overheating of his generator caused a devastating aftermath.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>17. Raven: Shadow Agent</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=24 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false><strong>Fighting Style:</strong> Ninjutsu</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Tekken is bringing its secret agent fighter back from the shadows for Tekken 8. Raven was first introduced in Tekken 5 as a secret intelligence officer for the U.N., alongside Asuka Kazama and Feng Wei. He was replaced by his superior Master Raven in the last installment, Tekken 7. He dislikes the Mishima clan, so fans can count him on Team Jin. He formed an alliance with Lars Alexandersson in Tekken 6 and will likely continue aiding him and Jin to defeat the G Corp.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>18. Azucena: Coffee Queen</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Bandai Namco has introduced the first brand-new character for Tekken 8, confirming the previously leaked rumors.

Tekken 8 will see Yoshimitsu investigating the occult practises of the Mishimas and searching through their archives. As usual his move set and aesthetic are imaginative and eye-catching, befitting the “space ninja” theme.</p><h2 id=h-20-steve-fox-counter-punching-paragon data-injectable=false>20.

By now he knows he’s Nina Williams’ son, though as he’s a test subject she doesn’t necessarily consider herself to be his mother. Anyhows, it seems finally learning the secrets of his origin has left Steve without his “driving force”, but his buddies Paul Phoenix and Marshall Law are going to reignite that spark by throwing him back into the ring.</p><h2 id=h-21-sergei-dragunov-white-reaper data-injectable=false>21.

As of Tekken 8, he’s a free agent, having been granted extended leave in recognition of his many achievements. How’s Sergei going to use his free time? Well, by doing the exact same thing as he did at work: clobbering people.</p><h2 id=h-22-leo-klieson-seeker-of-truth data-injectable=false>22.

Formerly Heihachi’s pet, Kuma has donned some of his clothes and taken up his fighting style. It seems he’ll be searching for Heihachi, likely joining the fight against G Corp.</p><h2 id=h-24-shaheen-desert-falcon data-injectable=false>24.

In Tekken 8 he’s lost all logical reasoning and seems to be an unstoppable destructive force, leaving all connection to humanity behind him. His fighting style will likely be influenced by his jet-black wings, which give him the power of flight.</p><h2 id=h-31-victor-chevalier-refined-violence data-injectable=false>31.

Her official bio only mentions that she’s a student at Mishima Polytechnical School, but that’s it. We’re betting she has deeper connections to the Mishimas than she’s letting on, perhaps yet another long-lost family member? Either way, she’s all about speed.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When does Tekken 8 come out?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=false>The anticipation for Tekken 8 is at an all-time high and the game itself will be released on Jan. 24, 2024, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.
