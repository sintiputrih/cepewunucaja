The Emmy-winning actress was fighting cancer. Her trust in Scientology reappeared online after her death. On Monday, the family of the Look Who’s Talking actress issued a statement. It said:</p><p>“We are really saddened to tell you that our beautiful, strong, and beloved mother has died after a brief struggle with cancer.” She was surrounded by her closest relatives and battled valiantly, leaving us with the assurance that her never-ending pleasure of life and whatever experiences were ahead.”</p><p>True and Lillie Parker, her children, made the announcement. Kirstie Alley rose to prominence in 1987 as Rebecca Howe on the sixth season of Cheers. In 1991, she won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for her performance. She has since worked on a variety of projects, including Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Summer School, and the Village of the Damned.</p><p></p><h2>Kirstie Alley belonged to the Church of Scientology. The actress vehemently supported religion.</h2><p>The native of Wichita, Kansas, dropped out of college and relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a profession in interior design. She also wanted to further her budding relationship with Scientology at the time. This follows her fight with drug abuse in 1979. She went on to praise Scientology and its Narconon treatment program for helping her overcome her cocaine addiction.&nbsp;She teased the publication of a tell-all book about Scientology with the goal of sharing her trust in the church with her fans. A source told OK! Magazine about the situation:</p><p>“It’s therapeutic for Kirstie to express her experiences.” And if she believes her religion is being scrutinized or questioned, she will confront whoever comes her way.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kirstie-Alley-1.jpg alt="Kirstie Alley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kirstie Alley had a battle with former Scientologist Leah Remini, who was on a quest to bring the cult down. Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, an award-winning A&E series, was also published.&nbsp;Initially, the two were pals. However, the relationship fell apart once Remini quit practicing the faith.</p><p>Alley has previously commented, in reference to Remini:</p><p>“I believe that attacking another individual’s beliefs is the most despicable thing a person can do.” So you are my adversary when you make the sweeping assertion “Scientology is wicked.” I just will not have such folks in my life. “I simply believe it’s just inappropriate.”</p><p>Alley then referred to Remini as a “bigot.”&nbsp;A source informed RadarOnline about the actress’s religious devotion:</p><p>“She’s regarded as Scientology’s unofficial bulldog and the religion’s momma bear.” She’ll always support it.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kirstie-Alley-2.jpg alt="Kirstie Alley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>From 1983 until 1997, she was married to Parker Stevenson.
