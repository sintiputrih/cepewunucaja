Beachgoers in South Africa’s Britannia Bay were utterly stunned to discover a 14-foot-long giant squid dying on the sand last week.

He also said the largest squid ever found in South Africa was beached in 1992 and measured 30 feet.</p><p>“It’s rare,” he said of these sightings. “In South Africa, we have had less than a handful of standings. Surprisingly, despite our museum being almost 200 years old, our earliest stranded giant squid specimen is from 1972.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284295 alt="Giant Squid At Iziko Museum" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/giant-squid-at-iziko-museum.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284295 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Dr. Wayne Florence/Iziko Museums of South Africa</span><span class=caption-body>Females can reach up to 60 feet long.</span></p><p>The creatures are so elusive, in fact, that some beachgoers who saw this most recent squid didn’t even know what it was. Davies himself admitted that he had to Google the creature and then learned that he’d had a “once-in-a-lifetime sighting.”</p><p>Though he did his best to roll the young giant back into the ocean, he left it to “die in dignity.”</p><p>“Unlike most large animals, squid generally grow very quickly and only live for about five years,” said Dr. Florence. “They have annual rings but these have to be dissected and also analysis of the beak can give an indication of age.”</p><p>These creatures usually live to be about five on average.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284297 alt="Giant Squid's Mouth" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/giant-squid-tentacle.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284297 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Dr. Wayne Florence/Iziko Museums of South Africa</span><span class=caption-body>The giant squid’s beak-like mouth is usually hidden.</span></p><p>“Since this giant squid is just over [14 feet] in total length, based on expert opinion of other larger specimens, this beast was probably less than two years old.”</p><h2>What Little We Know Of The Giant Squid</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284304 alt="Giant Squid From Logy Bay" width=600 height=918 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/giant-squid-from-logy-bay.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284304 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A giant squid found in Logy Bay, Newfoundland in 1873.</span></p><p>It’s no surprise that Dr. Florence and his colleagues are so fascinated by the giant squid found in Britannia Bay last week. For centuries, the species was considered to be the stuff of myth and was often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dismissed</a> as the legendary Kraken of Nordic folktales.</p><p>But given the creature’s size and rarity, it’s easy to understand why that it is. For one thing, a giant squid’s eyes can be as big as dinner plates.</p><p>The giant squid’s existence has only been scientifically accepted for about 150 years, following an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1848 sighting</a> off the African coast of the island of St. Helena and several subsequent sightings of the animal either dead or alive.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284302 alt="Giant Squid From Saint Paul Island" width=600 height=771 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/giant-squid-from-saint-paul-island-illustration.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284302 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration of a giant squid found ashore on Saint Paul Island in 1874.</span></p><p>Nonetheless, a giant squid had never been photographed alive until 2002. The first time the species was even captured on film in its natural habitat was 2013.</p><p>Naturally, we are still learning about this singular species. Only earlier this year was the full genome of the giant squid sequenced for the first time — which revealed that they are remarkably intelligent.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284305 alt="Illustration Of The Alecton Giant Squid" width=600 height=925 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/illustration-of-the-alecton-giant-squid.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284305 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An 1884 illustration from Henry Lee’s Sea Monsters Unmasked, which depicts a doomed crew fending off a Kraken-esque squid.</span></p><p>As for the giant squid found in Brittania Bay, experts are grateful for its near-perfect condition so that it can be properly studied. As it stands, Dr. Florence and his colleagues have taken tissue samples for DNA analysis.</p><p>In the end, this giant squid will be preserved as further proof that its elusive species is more than mere myth.</p><p>After learning about the giant squid found in South Africa, read about <a href=#>the 14-foot giant squid that washed ashore on a New Zealand beach</a>.
