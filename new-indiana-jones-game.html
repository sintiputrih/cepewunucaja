This first-person single-player adventure puts us into the shoes of the titular explorer and shows brief spats of combat alongside some storytelling cinematics, and while a lot of the content of the game remains a mystery, this is a solid first look at what to expect.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to this gameplay reveal, Bethesda <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1349023307228704770>shared</a> a teaser trailer on Twitter in January 2021 that officially announced the new Indiana Jones game, though it had more Easter Eggs than actual information. The trailer pans across a desk covered with books, a camera, and papers before landing on Dr. Jones' signature fedora hat and whip. It's not much, but it's enough to get us excited. There seem to be plenty of clues lurking about, too.</p><p>If you want to keep your finger on the pulse of any new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle developments, keep an eye on the official <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/bethesda>Bethesda Twitter page</a>.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-story-and-setting><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle story and setting</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Given it's an Indiana Jones game we'll be able to expect an exciting, pulpy adventure full of brash heroism and relics of antiquity.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, the teaser and gameplay trailer do offer some useful tidbits that an enterprising viewer could use to piece together some parts of the plot. Given the trailer shows a map of Vatican City as well as writing that partly says, "I will be arriving in Rome", it looks like we'll see Dr. Jones adventuring in Italy, alongside the introductory cutscene of the trailer that suggests a brief stint in Africa.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the fact that Indy's plane ticket is dated 1937, our hero may have to contend with the machinations of Italy's ascendant fascist party as Europe teeters on the brink of the Second World War. This also means that the game will be (at least partially) set a year after the first Indiana Jones movie: Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><p>The books of "Ancient Circles", "Forbidden Stones" and "Myths that Made Us" suggest that, in typical Indiana Jones fashion, the adventure will feature occult myths and ancient artifacts with supernatural powers.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-news><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle news</span></h3><p><strong>A new gameplay trailer offers a 2024 release date<br></strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle received a title and a release window as part of the Xbox Developers Direct on January 18, 2024.
