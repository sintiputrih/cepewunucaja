Doubling down on his fervent commitment to the sport of boxing, the influencer-turned-boxer is partnering with <strong>USA Boxing</strong> ahead of the <strong>2024 Paris Summer Olympics.</strong> His association with the team does not come in the capacity of a participant. However, it sees the fighter in a much different role than what he is used to in the boxing realm.</p><p>Coming fresh from his <strong>Andre August</strong>, 1st round knockout victory, Paul had made his desires clear that his next step in the sport would be to pursue a titular fight. However, with his recent tie-up with the national boxing team for the Paris Olympics, it seems like the fighter will be busy for a while now. But what will be his role?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Jake Paul’s new role with US Boxing</h2><p>In an Instagram post, the fighter informed that he would be training with the US Olympic team in Colorado Springs. He would also be traveling to Paris with them, where the tournament is slated to happen. In the post, Paul revealed, “I’m honored to partner with USA Boxing as the 2024 Paris Olympics approach. I’ll be training with the Olympic squad in Colorado Springs this winter and accompanying them to Paris this July to amplify our country’s best amateur boxers.”</p><p>As per <strong>ESPN</strong>, the fighter will be covering the team’s activities on his social media platforms. It is a bid to raise awareness among folks about the boxing team in specific and amateur boxing at large. Additionally, Paul has also been asked to educate the team on how to grow their brands, a skill at which Paul still remains a master.</p><p>In a statement, <strong>Mike McAtee</strong>, the executive director of USA Boxing, noted, “Jake’s mentorship will be a vital resource to the young athletes on Team USA to ensure they capitalize on building brand IP as they get the opportunity to perform on the biggest stage in the world at the most iconic contest in history: the Olympics.”&nbsp;Throughout his boxing career, ‘Problem Child’ has always reiterated his steadfast commitment to uplifting the sport in the US.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Paul’s branding lessons</h2><p>It is undeniable that Paul’s rise to notoriety in the sport has nudged stakeholders to see the significance of branding. He can strike a chord among his fans that makes sure his fights are sold out. At his recent Andre August fight, <strong>Joshua Edwards</strong> and <strong>Morelle McCane</strong> were also present. The two qualified Olympians walked out with Paul after the fight to create content with him. It is clear that rising boxers need to leverage the idea of personal branding to power through the sport.</p><p>Be it his lessons on personal branding or his NGO, <strong>Boxing Bullies,</strong> which hosts awareness events for young boxers on the ill effects of bullying, Paul remains committed to aiding rising boxers. Further, his stint with the Olympic team is another example of that.</p><p>Do you think Jake Paul was the right choice for this position?
