Though rules and restrictions change from season to season, the objective has always remained the same: Make RuPaul laugh. It’s the mother of all comedy challenges on a reality show, and we’ve seen some, shall we say, varied results over the years. Ahead of season ten’s highly anticipated Game of Snatch, we look back on all the performances throughout Drag Race herstory with this comprehensive list of every Snatch Game impersonation (not counting the first season of All Stars, which had an alternative take on the game), ranked from least to most hilariously Snatched. Between the obvious duds and the wide swath of mediocre performances that take us through to the all-time greats, let’s see where we’ve got a match!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnk1kt001d3b60grxlpl9w@published>87. Alyssa Edwards as Katy Perry (Season 5)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ff2/21b/508f9255598ca41842ea5ffe4610a4fd54-87-alyssa-edwards-katy-perry.rhorizontal.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjgqmnbd8006z3k60ft1u8nc6@published data-word-count=110>A truly heinous impression that isn’t only a complete miss aesthetically, but also demonstrates a misunderstanding of both the assignment (be funny!) and of Katy Perry herself. After RuPaul asked whether she’s kissed a girl, Alyssa’s response — “Ru, never!” — suggested that she had no idea what “I Kissed a Girl” is about, and that she should have picked literally anyone else to impersonate. We already knew Alyssa existed in her own world, but this was next level. She had immunity that week and was spared from elimination, but Alyssa earns the bottom spot on this list for the hands-down worst Snatch Game performance ever. Without condition. Unconditionally, even.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnkfhj001k3b60ystk8aui@published>86.

The latter is the issue here, since Max did a decent job of looking like the spooky queen we all know and love, but had no jokes to supplement the visuals. You’d think that an incorrect answer would at least set her up for a “Welp, back to Party City where I belong,” but no such luck!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnkq5a001r3b60ibd4ch0i@published>85.

Maybe we should give Sonique the benefit of the doubt — this was the very first Snatch Game, back in 2010 when Gaga was arguably more nondescript — but her performance was devoid of any quality whatsoever, and that’s reason enough to rank her so low. And we don’t need a million reasons, just one good one.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnl0hv001y3b60d7vbsbhj@published>84.

But mimicking such cadences is not Kenya Michaels’s strength, and her performance went completely bonkers as soon as she started falling out her chair and farting and screaming. If it was too much for Latrice Royale, it’s too much for us.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnlanb00253b60b1bgxqw8@published><span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase">83.

If only! Unfortunately, Morgan was supposed to be Pink. While she looked the pop-rock part, the party never got started, and answering Ru’s question about being on a game show for the first time with “It’s not my first one, but it’s my first game show” was her death knell.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnlpvo002i3b60o9g2ue8y@published>82.

Sure, she mentioned Little Monsters. Yes, the look was passably Gaga. But nothing about this was lived in. Phi Phi seemed to have given Gaga’s Wikipedia page a cursory read, thrown on a pleather outfit, and called it a day. Not known as a comedy queen, Phi Phi definitely gets credit for going for it, but if you want to make Ru laugh, stick with some good old-fashioned jokes.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnm0nx002p3b60vpvqw7ra@published>81.

If you’re a drag queen playing Joan Crawford in the Snatch Game, you’d think there’d be a wire hanger involved instead of a wooden one, for Christina’s sake. Going for measured, small, and poignant isn’t gonna snatch you the win in Snatch Game, kids! In a Dunaway as Crawford manner of hysteria, we bellow: No. Restrained.

There’s zero POV here, and God bless Gia for thinking that “big black dick” was a comedically earned answer in any way. Kim K. is always going to be a tough Snatch Game play, since she isn’t necessarily larger than life in terms of behavior and doesn’t really have a fun attitude to lean into. Gia found this out too late, and unfortunately became the victim of one of Bianca Del Rio’s merciless tirades as Judge Judy. Not knowing the correct term for morning sickness doomed her from the start, and this performance was what ultimately sent her packing. Bye, fish.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnn85n003p3b60y9omq5hy@published>78.

Not a terrible thing to commit to. She got harshly critiqued by the judges, but we’re not ranking her very low since she was scrappy with her decision-making. It wasn’t that bad, and Michelle Visage would go on to say that it was a great performance years later.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqo0cs7005q3b60vz44u11b@published>43.

Derrick Barry has made her living as the self-proclaimed “best Britney in Vegas,” making this decision a much bigger risk than you might think. If she was anything less than genius as Britney Jean in Snatch Game, it would impact not only her standing in the competition but her reputation as a Britney double in general. Luckily, Derrick did her favorite pop star justice, and every time she tossed her hair from side to side, we lived!

But this performance, in which Alexis repeatedly attempts to offer her phone number to Amber Rose, was infectiously fun. A lot of its charm has to do with how much fun Alexis had, but the highlight has to be when she answered what product Dirty Diana uses to wash her hair by revealing the word “DUSH” on her card, because we lose our goddamn minds every time. It’s an example of how an impression doesn’t need to be actually good or right to be very good and dead on. This is not the way Alicia Keys behaves in real life by any stretch, and that was definitely not how you spell douche, but god damn it if Alexis’s ideas about both weren’t brilliant.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqoa4ku00af3b60sbporvo9@published>19.

Sure, 90 percent of this was directly quoting lines from Mommie Dearest, and there was very little to no vocal affect at all, but Alyssa completely sold you on it because she was having the most fun. “Barbara please!” coming out of nowhere and “This ain’t my first time … at the Snatch Game” were both designed to slay in this format, and Alyssa finally understood the assignment three years after botching her first go at it. Forget Roxxxy Andrews; this is the real redemption arc of the whole series, or at least the moment that made Alyssa’s glow-up so undeniable.

Still, her performance as Monique — or rather, as Mary from Precious — felt fresh and topical back in 2011. At the time, this character was still front and center in the cultural consciousness, and was almost tailor-made to be sent up by drag queens nationwide. Stacy Layne was more than up to the challenge, cutting an imposing and comic figure at the same time.

It was an inspired choice that spoke to Adore’s self-awareness as she leaned into her strengths as a lovable slipshod, and flashed a spotlight on her as a magnetic performer next to the likes of Bianca del Rio and BenDeLaCreme.

She knew exactly how to filter her intense verbosity through Suze Orman, and for her All Stars Snatch Game performance, she focused on showcasing her trademark eccentricity. Here we got a glimpse of just how bizarrely Katya’s mind works in a performance as one of the strangest, most visionary figures in today’s popular culture. This could have felt like a “been there, done that” situation, as we’ve all seen many, many impressions of Bjork over the years, but Katya’s version of the Icelandic diva was less a by-the-numbers “Watch me shout-sing about how I once was eaten by a mountain and survived” nonsense parade and more of a glimpse into Katya’s humor through the Björk lens. Bonus points for not coming out in a swan dress and for literally eating one of her answer cards.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqod25w00bs3b60ars2tdj9@published>12.

A quick look back at the tape confirms that Pandora’s Carol Channing made RuPaul laugh the hardest of any contestant that day, and therefore her loss is all the more confusing given that the challenge is simple: Make Ru laugh. Everything you would wish for in a drag queen’s take on Carol Channing was here: the voice, the irreverence, the manic look in her eye, the reference to a lovely bunch of coconuts. We aren’t necessarily in the “Pandora was done wrong!” crowd overall, but it’s very difficult to argue that this wasn’t the single best comedic performance on season two of Drag Race, maybe excluding Jujubee’s work in the soap-opera scene opposite RuPaul, but we digress.

The way she read other contestants as they struggled with their characters was simultaneously classic Bianca and classic Judge Judy, and as the game progressed, it became clear that this was the character Del Rio was destined to play, or at least the gavel she was destined to bang.

At the end of the day, it was a funny, faithful tribute.

To our shock and delight, Kennedy embellished her raunchy take on the glam rocker with howls and falsetto riffs that made this one of the all-time greats. The small compact mirror she peered into was the perfect touch, and her answer about Batman and Robin converting the Batcave into a bathhouse decimated the competition right then and there.

The best moment was when Bob extolled the virtues of Fleet-brand enemas, saying, “If you stay ready, you ain’t got to get ready.” Classic Carol!

When you consider the untouchable precedent she set for herself with Maggie Smith, this performance — which couldn’t have been more different in both rhythm and specificity — solidified BenDeLaCreme’s status as one of the best comedians in Drag Race canon. The interactions with Kristin Chenoweth were delicious, as were the back-and-forths with RuPaul.

After all, this is someone who has made her life’s work being the best goddamn Cher impersonator there is.

Jinkx Monsoon as Little Edie Beale (Season 5)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/815/cfa/ae19cc69967b25b9e3fd0a41cc2f9bfadb-2-jinkx-monsoon-little-edie.rhorizontal.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjgqmnbbq006w3k60uscn5ye9@published data-word-count=134>Had anyone else walked away with the Snatch Game victory on season five, it would have been “quite the scandal, actually.” We should have known that comedy and theater queen Jinkx would absolutely slay this reference to Jackie Kennedy’s odd cousin, who resided with her mother for years in a barely habitable, dilapidated house in the Hamptons and was the subject of the documentary Grey Gardens. Those familiar with Little Edie have to be blown away by the attention to detail Jinkx provided here, not only nailing the costuming (the revolutionary costume for today!) and accessories (the magnifying glass, even!), but also that bougie yet still Long Island accent. It’s the most lived-in, commemorative portrayal that Snatch Game has ever seen, while also managing to make us laugh so hard we get “siezures (sp?)”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqohsbc00dx3b608etmxp8l@published>1.

There was not a moment wasted, not a joke missed, not a dip in the commitment to the character, nothing. “Why don’t you come up and fuck me in the ass sometime?” You’ve got to be kidding. No other platform in today’s fragmented media landscape could facilitate a gem of a one-liner like that, and Alaska claimed that platform as her own to give us as tight of a comedic performance as we’ll see on television. Ru himself couldn’t get enough of Alaska’s Mae West, and he may have even been caught a little off guard at how ready she was to absolutely smash every assist he threw her way. “You don’t beat around the bush, do you?” Ru asked, but before he even finished the question, Alaska swooped in with a “Whaddaya mean? I beat around the bush all the time!” The tiny moans, the snatched vintage look, the drooping tongue, it was all perfect. Comedically, it’s Old Hollywood meets raw Alaska humor, and so it bears repeating: It was all perfect. This was, plain and simple, the Alaska Show, and it gave us the single best Snatch Game showing yet.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Every Snatch Game Impression on RuPaul’s Drag Race, Ranked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyzwc%2BarKWrXZm%2ForOMq5icnV2ou6LAwqFkoJmdmnqquc%2BrnKyrmaS7tHnRmqWknZRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
