Chris also wasn’t shy to express his lack of attraction toward Paige, however, still slept with her throughout the season.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Married-at-First-Sight-Chris-Paige-3.jpg><p><span>Despite her new husband’s many flaws, fans were shocked as Paige continued to try to make the relationship work with Chris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Are ‘Married at First Sight’ Stars Chris and Paige Still Together?</h2><p><span>While viewers thought the couple would easily <a href=#>go their separate ways</a> on the season finale, that wasn’t the case. Not only did Chris apologize in a grand gesture for his mistreatment of Paige, but he revealed his ex suffered a miscarriage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m legitimately sorry for ruining this. You were what I needed in a wife, and I didn’t appreciate it,” Chris told Paige in front of the experts, during the May 2021 episode. “When I stated that I was afraid of falling in love, I meant that.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The pair ultimately decided not to <a href=#>stay married on Decision Day</a>. However, during the May 2021 reunion show, Chris and Paige revealed they had attended counseling in an attempt to fix the marriage. However, after things didn’t improve, the pair chose <a href=#>to divorce</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Who Is Mercedes Myrick?</h2><p><span>Mercedes was Chris’ ex-fiancé and the pair had ended things just a few months before Chris’ casting on the show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, Chris revealed Mercedes suffered a miscarriage only two months into her pregnancy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I wrestled with this but here it goes,” Chris wrote via his Instagram, revealing the bombshell in March 2021. “August 2020 I found out some of the greatest news I had heard ever. I would be a dad. Even though this was the case it was unfortunate given certain circumstances! I just wanted to be the best dad I could be. It was the most confused period I had ever experienced! My family was happy because there was going to be an addition to our family. “</span></p><h2>Where Is ‘MAFS’ Star Paige Banks in 2023?</h2><p><span>Following her time on the show, the accountant left with a “better understanding of who she is” and no longer speaks to her ex.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m not perfect, I never claim to be, but the reason I don’t want to speak on him is because there’s just nothing to speak about at this point,” she told</span> <a href=#><i><span>Essence</span></i></a><span> in November 2021. “He is a grown man and he can deal with his own actions accordingly, and I’ll handle mine as well. I don’t really have anything to say. Did I see it? Yes. Do I have a comment about it? No.”</span></p><p><span>Apart from traveling and purchasing a second home, Paige revealed during the </span><i><span>Married at First Sight: Decision Day Dish</span></i><span> in May 2022 that she was also writing a book.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Where Is ‘MAFS’ Star Chris Williams in 2023?</h2><p><span>While Chris’ <a href=#>relationship status</a> is currently unknown, the Chicago native keeps his followers updated on his travels and entrepreneurial ventures on social media.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJopJqqop6ypXnArWSfoaKowW6%2FyKCfrWWRp7Jur8eroKxlkaOxbrzAop6eZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
