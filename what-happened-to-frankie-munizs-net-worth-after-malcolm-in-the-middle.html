The series became a fan favorite during its seven-season run on Fox with its quirky humor, relatable characters, and innovative storytelling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With an average of 15 million viewers per episode, Malcolm in the Middle was among the highest-rated sitcoms of the 2000s. The show gained a cult following over the years, with its own dedicated fan site and even a video game.</p><p>The show ran from January 9, 2000, to May 14, 2006, with 151 episodes and seven seasons. While some of the show's actors and actresses have gone on to achieve greater fame and success, others have largely faded from the spotlight.</p><p>One actor who experienced a meteoric rise in the wake of Malcolm in the Middle's success was Frankie Muniz, who played the titular character of Malcolm.</p><p>After the series ended in 2006, Muniz seemed poised to become the next big thing in Hollywood. He won awards, landed numerous roles, and made cameo appearances in a variety of projects. But in subsequent years, Muniz's star began to dim, leading fans to wonder what had happened to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-frankie-muniz>What Happened to Frankie Muniz?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar49591252.jpg><p>Rumors about Muniz's health began circulating, fueled by a few clips taken out of context. Fans speculated the actor had suffered from strokes and memory loss, subsequently explaining his absence from the public eye.</p><p>Muniz was hospitalized twice, in 2012 and 2013, for what was initially suspected to be transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which are mini-strokes.</p><p>However, Muniz revealed on the podcast Steve-O's Wild Ride that he actually suffered from a pair of "aura migraines," which mimic strokes but are far less severe.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Frankie Muniz And Bryan Cranston Behind The Scenes On Malcolm In The Middle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Muniz also addressed the topic of memory loss on the podcast, stating that his memory loss is not as extensive as many claims but that he does have "a bad memory."</p><p>He attributed this to having had "nine concussions" and doing "so fucking much" during the early 2000s. Muniz was starring in multiple movies, appearing as a guest star on several television shows, and doing the media circuits, all while filming the last few seasons of Malcolm in the Middle. It's fair to assume that he simply can't recall all those details.</p><p>While Muniz may not have landed any major starring roles in the years following Malcolm in the Middle, he did continue to take on smaller parts in a variety of TV shows and movies.</p><p>He appeared in guest-starring roles on popular series like Criminal Minds and Bones and even made a cameo in the hit comedy series, Workaholics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Frankie Muniz's Tragic Illnesses Resulted In The Loss Of His Memory</a></span></p><p>Muniz also appeared on Dancing with the Stars in 2017 and took part in the spin-off series, Dancing with the Stars Junior, which features celebrity kids and their professional dance partners.</p><p>He also appeared on Total Bellas, a reality series that follows the lives of WWE superstars Nikki and Brie Bella.</p><p>While Muniz may not have become the superstar that some had predicted, he has certainly continued to make a name for himself in the entertainment industry. One way would be becoming a NASCAR racecar driver and a musician.</p><h2 id=frankie-muniz-musician-and-racecar-driver>Frankie Muniz: Musician and Racecar Driver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar47794577.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His passion for car racing can partially explain Frankie Muniz's absence from the acting world. Muniz got involved in car racing at a young age, helping with his first race in 2001.</p><p>He has since competed in several dozen races between 2004 and 2013. After taking a break from racing, Muniz returned to the track in 2021, debuting in his first-ever stock car race in Bakersfield, California. He also helped to test out the ARCA Menards Series in early 2022.</p><p>While music hasn't been a major focus for Muniz, he has dabbled in it over the years. He has been part of several bands, showcasing his talent as a percussionist.</p><p>In 2017, Muniz shifted into management, announcing on Facebook that he was the new manager for Astro Lasso. But, with the actor not having appeared in anything recently and seemingly only racing for a few races but owning a race team, what is his net worth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-frankie-muniz-39-s-networth>What is Frankie Muniz's Networth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar46069916.jpg><p>As of March 2023, Muniz has an estimated net worth of $45 million, with the bulk of his wealth coming from his starring role in the hit sitcom Malcolm in the Middle.</p><p>During the show's first season, Muniz reportedly earned $480,000, a figure that continued to rise with each subsequent season. By the second and third seasons, Muniz had earned $1.41 million. For the fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons, Muniz was paid $4.95 million in total. In the show's final season, his pay doubled to $150,000 per episode for the 22-episode season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did Frankie Muniz Make On 'Malcolm In The Middle?'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides his work on Malcolm in the Middle, Muniz has also made significant earnings from his other TV and movie projects.
