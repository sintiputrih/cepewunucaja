She sought and received a Juris Doctor (legal degree) from Gonzaga University in 1990 after receiving her BS degree.&nbsp;Cortez Masto started her legal career in 1990 when she was admitted to the Nevada State Bar. She also worked as a lawyer at the United States District Court for the District of Nevada in 1991 and at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1994. At various points in her career, the senior senator has worked as a civil attorney and a criminal prosecutor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Catherine-Cortez-Masto-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Catherine Cortez Masto eventually worked for former Nevada Governor Bob Miller, eventually becoming his chief of staff. Her spouse, Paul Masto, is a former US Secret Service agent whom she met while working for Governor Miller.&nbsp;Cortez Masto shifted from working in government offices for years until her term as deputy manager of Clark County (2002-2005) when she campaigned for state attorney general in 2006. Cortez Masto defeated the Republican candidate for Nevada Attorney General as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>After being re-elected to a second term in 2010, the Democrat served as the state’s attorney general from 2007 until 2015. Cortez Masto opted out of running for Governor of Nevada in 2014. She did, however, run for the office of US Senator from Nevada.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Catherine-Cortez-Masto.jpg alt="Catherine Cortez Masto" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The big change occurred when former Senate member Harry Reid opted not to fight for re-election in 2016. As a result, it prepared the path for Cortez Masto to succeed Reid and eventually win the election in a tight race with Republican challenger Joe Heck.&nbsp;Catherine Cortez Masto assumed office as a member of the United States Congress’s upper body on January 3, 2017. Coincidentally, the Democrat became the first Latina elected to the United States Senate.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqyYmr%2BqusRmmqiqpJrHbrnArKuoZZiWwG7DzqdkraCVYrumwsCdmGarlaOutbGMnqOem6SevK95xaipZqyYmnq0scKopZ1lpJ66pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
