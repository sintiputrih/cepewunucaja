In case you need a reminder, it depicts Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) becoming an unlikely herd as they set off on a mission to reunite a human child with its family.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>A critical and commercial smash, Ice Age earned itself an Oscar nomination and $383 million worldwide.</p><h2 id=h-ice-age-the-meltdown-2006 data-injectable=false>Ice Age: The Meltdown (2006)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ice-Age-The-Meltdown-Sid-Diego.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>It took a surprising amount of time for Ice Age to get a sequel, but one eventually followed four years later. The Meltdown massively expanded the cast of characters, introducing Manny’s love interest Ellie (Queen Latifah), as well as her possum pals Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck). As the title suggests, it sees the gang having to evacuate their home after the melting ice glaciers threaten to become a flood.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>The sequel enjoyed massive success at the box office, grossing $661 million.</p><h2 id=h-ice-age-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs-2009 data-injectable=false>Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ice-Age-Dawn-of-the-Dinosaurs.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>The franchise got a lot more high-concept for its third installment, which saw Manny and company discover a tropical land hidden beneath the ice that’s home to dinosaurs after Sid is kidnapped by a T-Rex. All the new additions from The Meltdown returned, along with Keke Palmer as Manny’s daughter Peaches and Simon Pegg as eccentric adventuring weasel Buck Wild (more on him later).</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>Dawn of the Dinosaurs grossed $887 million globally, making it the most lucrative entry in the series to date.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ice-Age-Continental-Drift.jpg><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>How do you one-up dinosaurs? The answer’s obvious: prehistoric monkey pirates! When the continent starts to shift, Manny and his herd are scattered across the sea, where they encounter a gang of piratical critters led by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage). Jennifer Lopez also joins the cast as Shira, another sabertooth and love interest for Diego. Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Rebel Wilson have cameos.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Continental Drift</a> brought home $877 million at the box office, just a fraction behind Dawn‘s total gross.</p><h2 id=h-ice-age-collision-course-2016 data-injectable=false>Ice Age: Collision Course (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ice-Age-Collision-Course.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>After dinosaurs and pirates, there was nowhere else for the franchise to go but… into space? Once Scrat turns astronaut in the latest quest for his chestnut, he accidentally causes a storm of asteroids to head for the Earth, leaving the Herd desperate to find a way to save the world. Adam DeVine, as Peaches’ dorky fiancé, and Jessie J as a female Sloth and Sid’s girlfriend were the latest additions.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, far fewer moviegoers collided with this movie than before as it only earned $406 million worldwide.</p><h2 id=h-the-ice-age-adventures-of-buck-wild-2022 data-injectable=false>The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild (2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ice-age-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Collision Course‘s financial performance seemed to have killed off the franchise, but Disney recently relaunched it with The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, a spin-off released exclusively on streaming. Simon Pegg was the only one of the original cast to return, with Manny and company voiced by new actors.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>This is also the first entry in the series not to be helmed by Blue Sky Studios, following the company’s closure in 2021.</p><h2 id=h-other-ice-age-content data-injectable=false>Other Ice Age content</h2><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>If you’re still looking for the right Ice Age installment to watch, fear not!

For starters, A Mammoth Christmas delivers holiday hijinks as Sid causes havoc for Manny’s family festivities. The whole cast from the movies returned (except Keke Palmer, who was replaced as Peaches by Ciara Bravo). Note: A Mammoth Christmas is not currently available to stream on Disney Plus in the U.S., though it is in various other territories.</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=83 data-injectable=false><strong>Viewing order</strong>: A Mammoth Christmas takes place between the third and fourth films.</p><h3 id=h-ice-age-the-great-egg-scapade-2016 data-injectable=false>Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade (2016)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ice-Age-The-Great-Egg-Scapade-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=828 data-injectable=true>Alongside a Christmas special, there’s also the Easter special The Great Egg-Scapade. As Manny and his clan celebrate Easter, Sid starts up a babysitting business where he watches people’s eggs for them. Meanwhile, Crash and Eddie start a prank war to mark April Fool’s Day. Keke Palmer came back as Peaches for this one.
