When announcing her birth in 2019, the couple shared a similar Instagram message, noting that they wouldn’t share snaps of the little one to protect her privacy.</p><p>“We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter, Raddix Madden,” the duo wrote at the time. “She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family.”</p><p>In 2022, an insider exclusively told Us Weekly that Diaz and Madden were thinking about <a href=#>expanding their family</a> after welcoming Raddix.</p><p>“Cameron and Benji have discussed having another child and have even been looking into surrogate options for a while now,” the source said at the time. “Benji always wanted a big family, and Cameron didn’t need to be persuaded after the arrival of their daughter.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The insider added that the pair were hoping for a little boy to complete their family. “They would love a boy, of course, but just want a healthy baby,” the source told Us. “The surrogacy with their daughter was something they had a lot of doubts about going in. It turned out to be the best thing they ever did.”</p><p>In 2021, Diaz said that motherhood has been the most “fulfilling part” of her life so far. “I waited for this … so I didn’t have any distractions,” she explained during an appearance on SiriusXM’s Quarantined With Bruce. “Like, I can’t imagine [working right now]. As a mother with my child, to have to be on a movie set that takes 14 hours, 16 hours, of my time away from her — I just couldn’t.”</p><p><a href=#>Diaz took a hiatus</a> from acting in 2014, but her first new movie in a decade is set to premiere this year. She will star alongside<strong> Jamie Foxx</strong> in the upcoming Netflix film Back in Action, which also features<strong> Glenn Close</strong>, <strong>Andrew Scott</strong> and <strong>Kyle Chandler</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmZ2av7C6jJ2gmrJdlrulecGepaOhXaKupbDEp2Sapp6kwq%2BvxGaZoqqknXqwsoybmJuxXaO8bn6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
