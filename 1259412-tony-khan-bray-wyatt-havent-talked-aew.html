Tony Khan appeared on WFAN’s Moose And Maggie show on Tuesday and was asked by Maggie Gray about the potential of bringing in another free agent in the form of Bray Wyatt (aka Windham Rotunda). Khan noted that he’s had a relationship with the former WWE Champion in the past, but they haven’t really discussed business with each other."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’ve known him in personal life and I’ve gotten to spend a little bit of time with him, but as far as that, we haven’t talked. I saw lots of rumors but that’s not something anybody’s really talked about. But I think, you never know.”</p><p>Bray Wyatt was released by WWE on July 31, and his non-compete clause is still in effect. It was <a href=#>previously reported</a> that he was “expected” to sign there, but he legally cannot sign with AEW yet.</p><p>Aside from responding to a few fan comments on Twitter, Bray Wyatt has mostly been silent on social media since being released. He did take some time to congratulate Big E for his WWE Championship win, which you can read in full at <a href=#>this link</a>.</p><p>Khan also discussed the success of AEW Grand Slam, and revealed that AEW will present a new “Buy-In” special on Friday as a lead-in to AEW Rampage.
