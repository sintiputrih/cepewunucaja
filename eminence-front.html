The Who Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks People forget
Forget they're hidingBehind an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on
It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put on"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It starts off describing how people tend to forget their worries when they are out having fun, forgetting the stressors they have in their life. However, the chorus of the song tells us that it is a put on, a facade. The repeat of the phrase "it's an eminence front" emphasizes how insincere and fake the party scene can be.</p><br><p>The song goes on to describe how people dress up to socialize and indulge in drinking while forgetting their problems, and how the news about the world and stock market crash can also disappear in light of the fun they are having. Finally, the song ends on a note to "dress to kill" to become a part of the facade that everyone is participating in.</p><br><p>Overall, "Eminence Front" is a critique of the entertainment industry and the facade that it puts up, where people can forget about their problems and indulge in the manufactured happiness that is presented to them.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean
