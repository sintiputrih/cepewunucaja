Happy shopping!</p><p>Let’s be honest, as much as we love to flaunt the perfect blowout, regular visits to our go-to stylist can leave a huge dent in our wallet. Sure, we love the convenience of leaving our hair in the care of our trusted expert, but our busy schedules often can get in the way of&nbsp;making an appointment. So, the only choice we have is to take our styling into our own hands.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Drybar</a>, we can now create a chic blowout in the comfort of our own home! The brand has just released a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">limited edition kit</a>&nbsp;exclusively on Nordstrom that will make salon-worthy hair a breeze to DIY. While a blowout can seem like a difficult technique to master, this product will help Us achieve the perfect look with ease.</p><p>A dream for anyone who already loves to style their own hair and for those ready to learn, we look forward to boasting a red carpet ready look with no salon appointment needed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Drybar%E2%80%99s-The-Most-Wonderful-Kit-of-the-Year-Collection-.jpg><p><strong>See It: Grab <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Drybar’s The Most Wonderful Kit of the Year Collection</a> exclusively at Nordstrom for only<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored"> $199</a> with a $288 value while it’s still in stock!</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Drybar’s Most Wonderful Kit of the Year Collection</a> is the <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> that keeps on giving!

The popular product line is determined to make the perfect blowout easy and accessible and this 9-piece kit will work wonders with every use.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Buttercup Blow Dryer</a>&nbsp;is designed with Nanolonic technology that breaks up water quickly for reduced drying time. Created to provide Us with the shiniest and smoothest blowout, this dryer has nano beads that work to smooth and seal the hair cuticle while trapping moisture for a healthy look. Complementing this dryer is the <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Super Lemon Drop Daily Detangler Brush</a>, the perfect tool for wet or dry hair.</p><p>Every blowout begins with a wash so this kit also includes shampoo and conditioner from Drybar. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">On The Rocks Clarifying Charcoal Shampoo</a>&nbsp;is meant to remove impurities and product buildup without stripping our strands. The <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">On the Rocks Lightweight Replenishing Conditioner</a> is also a major plus that helps to rejuvenate dry and damaged hair without the heavy feel.</p><p>After our wash and conditioning session, we must prep our hair to take on the heat without any damage. This is where the <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Prep Rally Prime & Prep Detangler and Triple Sec 3-in-1 Texturizing Spray Blanc Scent</a> comes in! There is nothing worse than heat damage and the detangler makes sure to protect our tresses from excess heat while leaving the hair soft and conditioned. The texturizing spray also refreshes the hair to give Us instant texture, volume and body. Say goodbye to lifeless strands and limp hair!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Drybar%E2%80%99s-The-Most-Wonderful-Kit-of-the-Year-Collection-1.jpg><p>What we love most is that this kit is created to travel with Us.

Shoppers also dig that the kit allows you to try out the products without committing to the full size, while others love how quickly and efficiently it works. One reviewer shared that this kit is definitely worth the splurge!</p><p>Priced at $199 with a $288 value, this kit is worth every penny!
