Ryan explained that their romance began on a double date with different people, but it was "the most awkward date" for their partners as there were "fireworks" between himself and Blake.</p><p id=e6xd868flKkH data-wc=27>"We were buddies for a long time, which I think is the best way to have a relationship," Ryan told Entertainment Weekly in a 2016 radio interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c456899f5ed-blake-lively-pregnant-angel-ball.jpg><p id=ezHreTo7Qfae data-wc=49>Blake similarly explained to Glamour magazine: "I treat him like my girlfriend," and she<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;turns to him for advice</a>.

He treats me like his best buddy."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ3jOYqSG3Tr data-wc=64>She even plainly admitted that their solid friendship is what she believes to be their "secret." "He's my friend, first and foremost, still", she told <a class=hm-link href=#>Sirius XM</a>. "Not just in our history, but in everyday life. He's my friend first and I think that's the secret to happiness.

They never miss the opportunity to make a quick-witted joke at the expense of one another, whether it's Ryan pointing out Blake's photoshopped heels in a photo of her voting, or Blake cropping her husband out of a photo of herself with Ryan Gosling as she wished him a happy birthday.</p><p id=eVtpQZLtlv-4 data-wc=54>The A Simple Favour star told HELLO! that <a class=hm-link href=#>his humor has rubbed off on her</a>. She explained: "My husband comes from improv comedy, so all day long we're teasing each other and having fun, so just being married to him has sharpened my comedy skills unlike any crash course I could take in comedy."</p><h3 dir=ltr>Empathy</h3><p id=eqUDHVvAQ8or data-wc=37>Jokes aside, they have shared sweet words for one another in the past. Praising his wife, he told Humans of New York: "She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy.&nbsp;</p><p id=efMd7nm0ZtHU data-wc=56>"She'll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old. And she's made me a more empathetic person. I had a very fractured relationship with my father. Before he died, she made me remember things I didn't want to remember. She made me remember the good times."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b0b4a05faec-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-wrexham.jpg><p id=e2xP5IAmXsZH data-wc=59>He also <a class=hm-link href=#>got tearful</a> during his speech while accepting his Icon Award at the 2022 People's Choice Awards. "Thank you Blake and my three daughters," he said. "Blake and my girls, you are quite literally my heart, hope and happiness.
