She doesn’t outshine William, but still has a lot to say herself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An additional source added that Kate "is the sort of woman who will take on whatever she needs to. If she needs to step up to the plate, she does it — and she always has. She and William are a formidable team."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People&nbsp;adds that it does go both ways, with William letting Kate shine when they're at events where she's the patron, or if a specific charity or organization is especially important to her.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdlk522rbCMmqqknZRitaa%2BjLCfqGWjnbJuw8CsZKaZoqe2prCMraZmr5mhuaqtzGZvbHBnZYF5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
