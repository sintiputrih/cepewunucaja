 Large toilet tanks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but they normally measure 16 3/4 inches to 18 inches broad.
 In the same vein, how large is a regular toilet tank? Dimensions of a typical toilet The total height of a one-piece gravity toilet may range from 21 to 30 3/4 inches (53 to 78 centimetres), with a gap between the floor and the bowl rim of 14 to 16 inches (356 to 406 millimetres)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The depth is normally between 27″ and 30″ (686 – 762 mm) while the breadth is seldom more than 20 in (508 mm).</p><h3>Is it also true that all toilet tanks are of the same size?</h3><p>&nbsp;The fact that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy to picking a toilet tank is evident even from a broad overview of how each of the numerous flushing systems works If there is one rule that applies to all sorts of flushing systems, it is that you will be given the option of choosing between either a one piece or a two piece model.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Just to clarify, how do I choose what size toilet to purchase?</h3><p>If your present toilet has four bolts on the rear, measure from the centre of the back bolts to the centre of the front bolts. The rough-in measurement is the name given to this measurement. In order to accommodate a regular toilet, the rough-in dimension should be between 11 and 13 inches in length. Maintain a record of this measurement for when you go to buy a new toilet.</p><h3>What is the physical size of a toilet rough?</h3><p>The distance between the completed wall and the centre of the toilet’s floor drain or waste outlet is referred to as the rough-in for the toilet. However, it is not uncommon for older houses to have a toilet with a rough-in of 10″ or 14″, which is rare for a toilet of this size.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What kind of area do you need to set aside for a toilet?</h3><p>A minimum distance of 15 inches (measured from the centre of the toilet) from any side wall or obstacle, and a maximum distance of 30 inches centre to centre from any other sanitary fixture, are required by most regulations. (The National Kitchen and Bath Association really recommends 32 inches.) When using a toilet or bidet, there should be at least 24 inches of unobstructed space in front of it.</p><p></p><h3>What is the ideal distance between a toilet and a wall?</h3><p>The normal distance between the back wall and the wall framing is 12 inches, or 12-1/2 inches measured from the centre of the flange to the centre of the wall frame. The distance between the toilet and the nearest wall or fixture is 21 inches at the shortest distance.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What are the dimensions of a toilet with a comfort height?</h3><p>Toilet bowls that are 17 to 19 inches high, as opposed to the typical 15 inches of a conventional toilet, are known as “comfort height” or “proper height” toilets. It is possible that a greater bowl height is beneficial to the knees and back, and that it may provide significant benefits to taller persons, the elderly, and those with mobility issues.</p><p></p><h3>What is the lowest toilet seat height available?</h3><p>A standard height toilet is defined as anything that is lower than 17 inches in height. If the toilet seat is taller than 19 inches, it will be considered a non-standard toilet and will be subject to the Exception clause to Section 604.4 of the American Disability Act for toilet seats.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the range of toilet sizes available?</h3><p>Twelve-inch variants are the most often seen, although 10-inch and fourteen-inch ones are also readily accessible. Comfort height toilets, which are around 17 to 19 inches high, or about 2 or 3 inches taller than standard height toilets, have been the most popular option in recent years.</p><p></p><h3>How long does a roll of toilet paper last?</h3><p>When toilet paper squares were 4.5 inches wide and 4.5 inches long, they were the individual sheets that combine to form each roll of toilet paper. Those standards, however, have evolved, or at the very least lessened their hold on the industry, to the point that businesses are now offering sheets that are half an inch shorter, half an inch thinner, and sometimes even half an inch shorter and thinner.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the proper way to measure a toilet rough in?</h3><p>To determine the rough-in length of your toilet, take a measurement from the wall behind the toilet to the centre of the closet bolts that secure your toilet to the floor. That distance will most likely be a little longer than the usual rough-in measurements of 10<span lang=zh-cn>′′</span>, 12<span lang=zh-cn>′′</span>, or 14<span lang=zh-cn>′′</span>. Round your measurement down to the closest conventional rough-in size to avoid confusion.</p><h3>When it comes to rough in toilets, what is the difference between a 10 inch and a 12 inch?</h3><p>Various Rough-in Measurements are available. In older houses, a 10-inch rough-in is the standard measurement for the rough-in. The 12-inch measurement, on the other hand, is the industry standard for contemporary toilet plumbing. Even while the 10-inch rough-in measures are still sometimes encountered in houses, they are often associated with a smaller number of toilets accessible.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the difference between a rough in toilet number 10 and a rough in toilet number 12?</h3><p>They are a measurement of the distance between the wall and the centre of the closet flange (in inches) (aka, where the johnny bolts that secure the toilet bowl go). Most toilet bowls will operate with either a 10<span lang=zh-cn>′′</span> or a 12<span lang=zh-cn>′′</span>distance, but a 10<span lang=zh-cn>′′</span> rough tank is thinner in order to accommodate the shorter distance.</p><h3>A toilet installation should not be prohibitively expensive.</h3><p>It should take between one and two hours to finish a typical toilet installation, which should cost no more than $348 on average. The cost of a basic installation will be roughly $11In the event of unexpected expenses, the cost might rise to as much as $800.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to convert a circular toilet to an elongated toilet?</h3><p>Toilets are typically available in two basic sizes: A round front — This toilet has a round bowl, which allows it to fit into a smaller area than other toilets. The bad news, in the past, was that if you wanted to replace a round-front toilet with an extended toilet, you had to deal with the fact that the longer toilet did not always fit the available space.</p><p></p><h3>When is the best time to replace my toilet?</h3><p>If you have clogs more than once a week, or if the clogs seem to be random and weird, it is likely that your toilet needs replacement. Simply replacing your current toilet with a more efficient and effective commode will preserve the water-saving benefits of using a low-flush toilet without sacrificing performance.</p><p></p><h3>What is the cost of a low-cost toilet?</h3><p>The most affordable toilet pricing is around $90 for a basic toilet. Different manufacturers might charge different prices for the same characteristics. Toilets in two pieces are less expensive than toilets in one piece. Single-flush systems are significantly less expensive than dual-flush systems.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSsrJGjsaK%2Bw2aqorKVYrynecBmq6ihnJrBbsDAp6JnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
