So when Brittany (Drew's wife) and I think about one of New Orleans [resident’s] basic needs, that is to make sure that they and their family are fed and they can continue to sustain. So that’s where we wanted to start.”&nbsp;</p><p>The future Hall Of Famer revealed in an Instagram post that the couple is committing $5 million to their home state and working with organizations in the community to "prepare and deliver over 10,000 meals per day throughout Louisiana for as long as it takes to children on meal programs, seniors, and families in need."</p><p>With the NFL star donating such a large sum of money, fans may be wondering just how much the longtime player is worth.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Brittany and I are committing $5,000,000 to the State of Louisiana in 2020. The priority now is helping our communities get through this tough time.
