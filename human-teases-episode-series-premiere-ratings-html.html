Just after its two-night series premiere, Almost Human is quickly becoming one of the best new science fiction series on television at the moment. While the cop drama’s ratings fell a bit when compared to Sunday night’s episode, Almost Human is holding steady in its regular timeslot on Monday nights at 8/7c. Fox has released a new promo for Almost Human‘s third episode, “Are you Receiving?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While the cop drama’s ratings fell a bit when compared to Sunday night’s episode, Almost Human is holding steady in its regular timeslot on Monday nights at 8/7c. Fox has released a new promo for Almost Human‘s third episode, “Are you Receiving?”</p><p>Almost Human is structured as a typical crime procedural with “case-of-the-week” stories and narratives. The overall story is mainly character based, with Kennex (Karl Urban) coming to terms with androids and his injuries, while Dorian (Michael Ealy) learns to be more human. Next week’s episode will feature the unlikely duo in a hostage situation, while a new weapon threatens the streets of future Los Angeles. Read the synopsis below:<span id=more-79365></span></p><p>The thrilling action continues in another all-new, adrenaline-fueled episode. Detective Kennex and Dorian battle an intense and futuristic hostage situation, while Captain Maldonado (Lili Taylor) attempts to meet the terrorist’s demands, hoping to protect innocent people in the all-new “Are You Receiving?” episode of ALMOST HUMAN airing Monday, Nov. 25 (8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX.</p><p>After two episodes, the best thing about Almost Human is the banter and chemistry between Kennex and Dorian. The science fiction backdrop is just an added bonus to see how the pair will interact with each other. Karl Urban’s Kennex is delivers a deadpan sort of humor, while Michael Ealy’s Dorian is far more playful and fun. It’s going to be interesting to see how their friendship develops.</p><p>Although Almost Human‘s second episode was consistent with its first, in terms of quality, the ratings for the sci-fi cop drama dropped in the second hour of its series premiere, which aired Monday night. Fox saw solid numbers for its <a href=#>Sunday night premiere</a> with a 9.1 million viewership, but it fell almost 29% to 6.6 million for its Monday night follow-up. Almost Human scored a 2.2 in the 18-49 demo, down from its 3.1 on Sunday night. One of the reasons for the fall was ESPN’s airing of NFL’s Monday Night Football between the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers (the Panthers won 24-20), which took in 15.77 million viewers.</p><p>On the bright side, Almost Human was up 5% from what usually airs on Monday night at that timeslot, the crime procedural Bones. The sci-fi cop drama also served as a healthy lead-in for Sleepy Hollow, which drew in 7.07 million viewers, with a 2.5 in the key demo.</p><p>Now that Almost Human has established its style and structure, it’s going to be interesting to see how the series will grow. In some ways, it reminds me of Fox’s science fiction TV shows from the early 2000s such as <a href=#>Firefly</a> and Dark Angel. Those shows had different storylines week after week, but audiences were drawn in because of its characters, rather than an overall big mystery. It’s refreshing to watch TV like that again. Sadly, Firefly and <a href=#>Dark Angel</a> were canceled way too soon, so hopefully their fate will not befall Almost Human.</p><p>Almost Human will air “Are You Receiving?” on Monday, November 25, at 8/7c on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvHrqSapl2psqK%2FxKxknqiZqLylsYysnKuhlah6sb7EpqCeqpViv6LAyKeerGaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
