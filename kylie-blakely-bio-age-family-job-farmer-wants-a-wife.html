So, delve into this article to find out more about Kylie.</p><h3><strong>Kylie Blakely On Farmer Wants A Wife</strong></h3><p>Kylie Blakely&nbsp;on Fox’s original reality dating series Farmer Wants a Wife, charmed her way into Landon Heaton’s heart from the beginning. Landon praised Kylie’s work as an advocate for veterans’ issues in Orlando, Florida, outside of the show. Furthermore, Kylie acknowledged that she was one of the few ladies on the show with prior cattle drive experience during a spontaneous interview on Landon’s property.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kylie and Landon from Farmer Wants a Wife just weren’t meant to be. As previously reported by Distractify, there were no animosities between the two. Landon simply didn’t want to stop Kylie from doing the vital job she does outside of the show, and he thought that if she moved in with him, it would stop her from doing her advocacy work in real life.</p><p>In a recent post, Kylie added, “I’ve thought long and hard about how I want to go about this… Being a part of <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#FarmerWantsAWife</a> was truly a dream come true, I couldn’t have gotten to where I am without Tina, Ahmad & our countless phone calls leading up to the moments that I had no idea would change my life forever. From the moment I got to Nashville and started meeting some of the amazing women you’ve all grown to love on the show I knew I’d walk away with a farmer, some new best friends or both! My time on the farm and traveling with you girls to the mixers are times I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.”</p><p>On her Instagram page, Kylie only had positive things to say about her farmer ex, writing in one tearful farewell message (you know, the one ousted contestants make after their exit episode airs), “You’re [Landon] a good man and your mama did a good job raising you and an even better job of teaching you how to dance! God brings people together sometimes for lessons and you were one of mine.”</p><p>She added, “I know my forever is somewhere out there and I know God will bless you and whoever you choose!” Kylie thanked Fox for the “adventure of a lifetime,” and said she couldn’t wait for the finale.</p><h3><strong>Is Kylie Blakely In A Relationship?</strong></h3><p>No, Kylie Blakely doesn’t seem to be in a relationship currently.
