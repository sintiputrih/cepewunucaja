So, upon arriving, while she might have been a little concerned about Ariela and Biniyam’s living conditions, she never ridiculed it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was polite, and even visited the local hospital and gave it her approval for Ariela’s birthing. Moreover, she was also was open to learning all about Ethiopia and its culture.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And for this the viewers respected her. But it all changed in the later episodes when she acted too protective of her daughter. Rather than letting Ariela handle her matter, she tried to provide emotional and financial crutches.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Janice could be right in her world. Staying in the States would open up better facilities. But this would be right for Janice’s husband Biniyam, who already lost touch with his child by his former marriage to an American woman.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But then again, Janice never believed in Biniyam. She always felt that their relationship will come to an end someday, and she wanted to be close to her daughter when that happened.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over one of the episodes, Janice even warned Ariela about Biniyam’s ex-girlfriend. In case you missed it, this happened as the mother-daughter duo was sitting in a club and Biniyam stepped up to the state with a gorgeous female partner (who later Ariela relieved was his ex-girlfriend.)</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Better watch out, Ari, Especially when he’s dancing at night, and you’re home alone,” Janice said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Janice’s grandson Aviel was born in late 2019.
