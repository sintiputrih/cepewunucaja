Another added, “Leo is definitely pursuing Gigi.” A third insider added, "They've been seen hanging out with groups of people. It's only been a few weeks since the split. Since then, he's been hanging out with friends and family."</p><h2 id=gigi-was-originally-uninterested-but-leonardo-is-insisting>Gigi Was Originally Uninterested, But Leonardo Is Insisting</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was reported <a href=#>earlier this month that Leonardo was pursuing Gigi</a> in the wake of his break-up. At the time, however, it was said that the supermodel was only interested in being friends. "Leo does have his sights set on Gigi, but she hasn’t shown an interest,” a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “They’re friends, but she doesn’t want to be romantic with [him] right now.”</p><p>But now that they’ve spent more time together, it appears Gigi is reconsidering.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>No More Babies?

His break-up with Camila sent the Internet into an uproar, as she’d only just turned 25 when they split.</p><p>The couple were first romantically linked in 2018 after being spotted vacationing in Colorado together. But it’s been reported that Leo first met Camila when she was only 10-years old after being introduced through her stepfather Al Pacino, though it was many years before they started dating.</p><p>Camila previously addressed their two-decade age gap. "There's so many relationships in Hollywood — and in the history of the world — where people have large age gaps,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2019.</p><p>The model added, “I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gigi is 27, which is twenty years younger than 47-year-old Leonardo, but despite the age difference, many Internet memes have popped up questioning if Leo is aware that she’s older than his usual girlfriends. Nevertheless, it appears things are heating up between the pair.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Reveals Her Son’s Legal Name After Changing It</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqeelr%2Blu4ydoJyZoKe2sL%2BMmqutnZ2lwbR506hksKefYrSqs8hmn5qcmZl6or7EZqqtmaKptq%2BzjK2mZq%2Bfp7hw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
