And, as you could probably imagine, Oprah instantly made the show great and it soon surpassed Donahue, which was the highest-rated Chicago talk show at the time.</p><p>Soon after, she was convinced to sign a syndication deal with King World, and the show was then renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show. The first official episode premiered on Sept. 8, 1986, and lasted until May 25, 2011. In the early ’90s, the show averaged about 13.1 million viewers per day!</p><p>And while Oprah got famous by making a name for herself on TV after a tumultuous childhood, it was her bright personality and giving nature that really got her where she is today. Throughout the years, she became known for her big celebrity interviews on her shows (her 1993 interview with Michael Jackson became the fourth most-watched in TV event in American history), for giving away cars to the audience (“you get a car, you get a car!”), and for her emotional segments about topics like abuse and more.</p><p>On top of her talk show, Oprah is the CEO of a television channel called OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network), a magazine called O, The Oprah Magazine, and is also involved in a plethora of charities and philanthropies. In addition, Oprah has also appeared in movies including The Color Purple, Selma, and The Butler. Let’s just say Oprah has really made her mark on people everywhere — and her fame is something that will be remembered and cherished forever!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hprBllJ6xbrvPq5ihZaeeu6e%2BxLJkm52TpLqmecWapKito2J%2BdX2SaWpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
