As D’Onofrio clarified on Twitter, “I never said this to Tom Hollands Spidy.”</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>D’Onofrio went on to explain that he was merely speaking to “a fan from the audience” who was “dressed so cool as Spidey.” The fan had the mic during a Q&A at a Dallas fan expo, so D’Onofrio decided to have some fun with him. D’Onofrio said everyone laughed at the exchange, and added cosplayers “are such good people” with whom he loves to interact.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/vincentdonofrio/status/1668317774618165251?s=20</figure><h2 id=h-will-we-ever-see-d-onofrio-s-kingpin-confront-holland-s-spider-man-in-the-mcu data-injectable=false>Will we ever see D’Onofrio’s Kingpin confront Holland’s Spider-Man in the MCU?</h2><p data-characters=735 data-current-count=1035 data-injectable=true>Even though D’Onofrio clarified he wasn’t specifically talking about Holland’s Spider-Man during that particular quote, does that mean a confrontation is out of the question in the MCU? In my opinion, it’s still completely possible. Based on all the information we have so far, Holland will likely eventually make more Spider-Man films. Plus, D’Onofrio’s Kingpin appeared in the Disney Plus show Hawkeye. That means the supervillain has officially been inducted into the MCU proper, and thus, he does co-exist in the same continuity as Holland’s Spider-Man. What’s more, Charlie Cox’s Daredevil has already cameoed in the MCU, in both No Way Home and the Disney Plus show She-Hulk.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=false>More importantly, though, a live-action confrontation between Wilson Fisk and Spider-Man has yet to be committed to film. Given that the pair are such huge rivals in the comics, it would only make sense to let the pair go at it in a future movie in order to do something fresh with the franchise. I’ll be crossing my fingers in the hope such a pairing does occur, as I am a huge fan of both D’Onofrio and Holland.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooGamlauys3nSmqCdZaSdtrR51aKlnJ2eqXqlu82onauhn2KwrbHAq6pmraBirm65yKyaqKaTmr21tc6nZJqan6rBbq2MrKeinJWneq6tzWaaqKaWp7yvwMCtoKimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
