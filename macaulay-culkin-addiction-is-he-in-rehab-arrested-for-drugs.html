Macaulay said his Father was cruel and violent when he was a kid. He felt his dad was jealous of his career.</span></p><p><span>His parents separated when he was a teenager. He took his parents to court to prevent them from controlling his trust fund, reportedly worth $15 to 20 million. He has been estranged from his Father ever since.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=macaulay-culkin-was-arrested-for-drugs></span><span>Macaulay Culkin Was Arrested For Drugs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Macaulay Culkin is not currently under arrest.
