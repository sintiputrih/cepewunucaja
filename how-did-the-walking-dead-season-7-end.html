How We Left Off
Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) took out a lot of key players during season 7, including Glenn (Steven Yeun), Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), Spencer (Austin Nichols) and Olivia (Ann Mahoney), and the war nearly began in the finale. Rick (Andrew Lincoln) spent the majority of the season creating an army of his own, while trying to survive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everyone is ready to finally fight back against Negan, now that they have gathered up enough people to do so. Plus, they’re an actual unit again.</p><p><a href=#>Costars Reunited!</a></p><p>Daryl, specifically, who spent most of season 7 separate from the core group, is “very focused on revenge,”&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Norman Reedus</strong></a> told&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>.&nbsp;“He’s ready to kill everybody, no matter what the group says, no matter what anybody says. He’s just like, ‘Nah, screw it. Everybody dies.'”</p><p>“Season 8 feels like our old show again. The people I like working with the most are the ones I’m working with again,” the actor, 48, added. “The gang’s back together. The fight’s back in it. Last year was so rough. It didn’t feel like our show and I know it is our show, and you’ve got to do stuff like that, but last year felt so disconnected. Everyone was so disconnected in the core group. So it feels like it used to feel again which is really exciting.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# data-track-category="Article Page" data-track-action="Tap Interstitial Link" data-track-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-walking-dead-cast-what-they-look-like-on-the-red-carpet-2013133/>The Walking Dead Cast: What They Look Like on the Red Carpet</a></p><p>The Walking Dead premieres on AMC Sunday, October 22, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bor12ZtqV506GcZq%2BRobiqusZmm56ZlGLApq3SqKVmb12au6V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
