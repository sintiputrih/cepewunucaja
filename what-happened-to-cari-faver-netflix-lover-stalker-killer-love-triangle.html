After spending the night together on November 12, 2012, Dave said goodbye to the single mum and went off to work – this was the last time anyone saw her.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9f_4wiaObg data-wc=36>While it seemed as though Cari disappeared without a trace, she remained in contact with Dave, sending him, and his ex-girlfriend, threatening messages. Both Liz and Cari's mother, Nancy, also claimed to have received these messages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73521bb50ae4-lover-killer-stalker-cari.png><p id=eO5MPyHreX- data-wc=35>Alarm bells began to ring for Nancy when her daughter informed her that she'd accepted a new job in Kansas. The following weeks saw Cari miss several important family events, including her son's 15th birthday.</p><p id=eLA2x0IKP8R data-wc=45>By the spring of 2015, Cari hadn't been seen for two and a half years. This was when Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s Office investigator Ryan Avis and sergeant Jim Doty heard about the case, and were so intrigued by the story that they volunteered to investigate.&nbsp;</p><p id=eP77lrN5OoY data-wc=19>While re-examining evidence, the investigators found bloodstains in Cari's abandoned car, prompting them to look into the text messages.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/26faed36daf4-cari-mother-lover-stalker-killer.png><p id=eD3f_YwGLCq data-wc=57>After investigating the contents of both Dave and Liz's phones, they discovered that it was in fact Liz who had sent the messages via an app that allowed her to schedule texts and emails to impersonate Cari. They also found an SD card in her tablet which contained several deleted images, including one of Cari's dead body.</p><p id=e2pu5zTbmvkc data-wc=35>It was revealed that Liz had stabbed Cari to death in November 2012. Four years later, in December 2016, Liz was charged with first-degree murder and was later found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMhWr4eNQ1-B data-wc=21>Douglas County attorney Brenda Beadle, who prosecuted the case, said it was "by far the most difficult case I've ever tried."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7dbb286308a8-liz-lover-stalker-killer.png><p id=ej7FmuLFPQeA data-wc=55>She continued: "Most homicides are dark. This one was … bizarre to the point where it would take some convincing to make somebody believe that it actually happened. There's no way that someone would let their dog die in a fire that they started. There's no way that someone would shoot themselves in the femur."</p><p id=e3h2ooHAYQBb data-wc=9><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uaGxpYWV8uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2arqGWTlr%2BqecWarZ6qXaOytbLLoq9mpJ%2BrsrN50q2YpaOVp3qstculnKtlnKTDpnnTq6CappehsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
