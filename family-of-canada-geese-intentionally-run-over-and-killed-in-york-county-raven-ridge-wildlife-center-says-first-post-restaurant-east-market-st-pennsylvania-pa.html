It is heart-wrenching to think that these beautiful creatures suffered at the hands of someone who intentionally chose to harm them," Raven Ridge posted.<br></p><p>The wildlife center said it hopes that the two goslings will continue to recover in its care and emphasized how important it is that the person who ran them over be held accountable.</p><p>"Canada geese and goslings are protected by state and federal laws, and this incident is a clear violation of those protections," Raven Ridge wrote.</p><p>The wildlife center is asking anyone who witnessed the act or has any information that could help identify the perpetrator to get in contact with the <a href=# title=https://www.facebook.com/OperationGameThiefPGC class=themeColorForLinks>Pennsylvania Game Commission</a> or to call the Raven Ridge Wildlife Center directly at 717-808-2652.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLbAnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te8WapKKkqWK8p3nCmqWanJFitKax0p5koqakmru1tc6nmKWkqWK%2FtrqMqK2eql2Wu6V5yqKjpZ2UYravedioqaRlk6TCr8DYZqmarpWjerO1w6CcZq%2BZobGttcWeZJydnqmys3nSmrCsZZaev7TAjKmmrKxdp7K0wMCuqZqmpGKyor%2FTZqSaqpuawW6%2F02annqaeqMatwsCnoJploJY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
