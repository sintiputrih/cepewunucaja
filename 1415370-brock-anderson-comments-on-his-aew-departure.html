He last wrestled for AEW on the August 12 episode of AEW Collision, where he lost to TNT Champion Luchasaurus.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-arn-s-contract-status>Arn’s contract status</h2><p><a href=#>Arn Anderson</a>&nbsp;recently commented on Brock’s AEW contract status on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ARN</a> podcast. Arn was asked if Brock had re-signed with the company. “The Enforcer” said he did not, and although the deal expired at the end of August, they hoped he’d be back.</p><p>“Not yet, but it’s up at the end of the month,” Anderson said. “End of August, so we will see. I hope so. I hope he’s one of those guys, guys like him and Taz’s kid, and a lot of young talent that has a lot to offer. Just haven’t had the chance yet. I hope things work out and we’re able to stay.”</p><p>Arn has also said that his own contract ran into 2024, although he did not give an exact timeframe. Arn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestlingNews.co</a>‘s Steve Fall he’d “stay with AEW as long as they want me.”</p><p>“That’s my one thing, and I said that after I left, well, I was canned by WWE. I don’t want to be anywhere that I’m not wanted anyway,” Anderson said. “Not for one minute, not for any amount of money, not for one second.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbGxvYGKvs7vCpGSappSav7S7zWaaqKWdmru1v4yopWagmah6orHWZpueqJGnwba%2BxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
