User @madisonvdt suggests you dress — inspired directly by "Midnights" — in slouchy sweaters and sparkly skirts. Or, try leather-and-lace for a look that is both suited to a midnight rendezvous and a concert!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You can emulate Taylor's previous concert looks.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Taylor is known for putting on show-stopping performances during her tours, but her tour costumes are also pretty iconic.

Feeling edgy? Replicate a look from the "Reputation" tour with a black sparkly jumpsuit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wear and outfit inspired by Taylor's album covers.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Taylor has many iconic album covers, so if you're short on ideas, you can always try to mimic her looks there!

When Taylor Swift wore a reflective Balmain gown to the American Music Awards in 2018, fans immediately began to refer to it as the "mirrorball dress" following the release of her album "Folklore" for a song called "Mirrorball."</p><p>This is one of many examples of how fans have dressed as Taylor's lyrics, sometimes literally, like TikTok user @fearlessfallon!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Or you can dress like one of Taylor's muses.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For all of the flack Taylor gets for writing songs about her exes, how fun would it be to dress up as one of them attending her show? Maybe you're Jake Gyllenhaal with Taylor's old scarf or Joe Jonas with his early 2000s-boy-band-era haircut. Even Frankie Jonas, Joe's brother, took this route for Halloween when he and his girlfriend dressed up like Joe and Taylor.</p><p>Speaking of Taylor's muses, some fans have even taken to dressing like Jack Antonoff, such as TikTok user @luispabloromo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbq%2FOp5qeqqRivLbAxaKrZqGUmq60</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
