Yet that didn't mean fans could no longer catch up with Kailyn or see how her family was growing. Though she ditched MTV (in <a href=#>a move that many fans didn't approve of</a>), Kailyn kept up with her podcast and social media, letting followers look in while she continued to raise (and co-parent) her four boys; Isaac, Lincoln, Lux, and Creed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things haven't necessarily gone swimmingly for Lowry, though. Although most of the drama with her first two boys' fathers is in the past (Kailyn is pals and co-hosts with Isaac's stepmom Vee), Lux and Creed's dad Chris Lopez isn't on great terms with Kailyn. In fact, Chris Lopez admitted to physically harming Kailyn—and might have spilled some secrets about her personal life.</p><h2 id=kailyn-lowry-and-chris-lopez-have-always-had-drama>Kailyn Lowry And Chris Lopez Have Always Had Drama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kailyn-lowry-mtv.jpg><p>Fans will recall that after she welcomed son Lux with Chris Lopez, Kailyn Lowry had plenty of baby daddy drama. There were custody arguments, plenty of disses on either side, and the two eventually called it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Or, so fans thought. Later, Kailyn welcomed a second son with Chris, their baby Romello Creed, who apparently goes by his middle name. The two hadn't reconciled though; <a href=#>Kailyn would later drag Chris</a> for apparently going on a trip rather than helping her pay for their younger son's healthcare.</p><p>After all of that, fans could only hope that Kailyn would leave Chris behind for good... and maybe leave the financial and custody arguments in the courtroom.</p><p>But after some continued shade-throwing, including serious allegations made by Lowry, Lopez responded—and threw some shade of his own.</p><h2 id=kailyn-lowry-says-chris-lopez-physically-abused-her>Kailyn Lowry Says Chris Lopez Physically Abused Her</h2><p>After years of public discord with Chris Lopez, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kailyn Lowry gave a rundown of the "tumultuous and toxic" relationship</a> during a podcast interview. She stated that during her relationship with Chris, which spanned 2016 to 2020, he cheated multiple times but also became physically violent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kailyn claimed that Chris broke a window and a door in her home and that she had been choked by him once while holding their son. In a separate incident, Kailyn declared that Chris tried to "smother" her, but that she was still reluctant to call the police at that time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kailyn Lowry Was Rejected For A Return To Reality TV On Marriage Boot Camp, And The Reason Make A Lot Of Sense</a></span></p><p>Explaining her lack of action, Kailyn elaborated that she always hoped Chris would "get better" and "choose" her. Eventually, she did press charges against him, which resulted in probation, domestic violence classes, and a no-contact order for Chris.</p><p>But Chris Lopez, who took to TikTok immediately following Kailyn's podcast episode, claims that Kailyn wasn't telling the entire story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-lopez-says-kailyn-hit-him-first>Chris Lopez Says Kailyn Hit Him First</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chris-lopez-briana-dejesus-teen-mom.jpg><p>Chris Lopez has defended himself against Kailyn's claims multiple times but doesn't deny one specific incident where he did choke/smother Lowry. For that, he pled guilty to the crime (a misdemeanor), spent some time in jail, and was later given probation rather than a possible two-year sentence.</p><p>During a Teen Mom 2 reunion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lopez was asked about Kailyn's accusations</a> and said, "It’s been abuse on both sides... She’s making it seem like I really beat her. That’s the story going around, that I actually beat her. I never beat her. Did I threaten? I might have said some things out of anger…"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Teen Mom Cast Might Be Earning More On OnlyFans And Social Media Versus TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Addressing the smothering incident, Lopez stated, "I’m not gonna stand here and act like I’m innocent. I’ve done things. And I served [time in jail] for that. I got handed my punishment."</p><p>However, he also claimed that Lowry put her hands on him first, in a TikTok retort to Kailyn's latest accusations.</p><p>Speaking to Kailyn in his TikTok video, Lopez stated, "But if you want to sit here and tell the story of DV, then tell the part where you physically attacked [me]. Multiple times. Not just once, not just twice, not just three times either…so if you’re gonna tell the truth, tell the whole [expletive] truth."</p><p>Chris alleged that Kailyn was trying to "paint [him as] abusive," but that if she wanted to do so, should "say the part where you started hitting that man first."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-kailyn-lowry-have-a-fifth-baby>Does Kailyn Lowry Have A Fifth Baby?</h2><p>In his TikTok, Chris also discussed some of the issues he and Kailyn have had with co-parenting their two sons, including arguments over the division of time and responsibilities in getting their son to school on time.</p><p>Speaking to Kailyn's public comments about him, and the fact that he stayed quiet, Lopez commented, "I've never seen someone take advantage of someone keeping quiet for so long."</p><p>The clincher was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Chris stated</a>, "Seriously and I'm done bro...you claim to be so real so raw but yet you got a whole newborn you should be focused on and yet you're trying to create unnecessary drama to cover up that FACT."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of MTV’s Teen Mom Family Reunion May Get Paid Way More Than Fans Think</a></span></p><p>Not only did Chris call Kailyn out for her apparent lack of attention to their kids' needs, but also blew months of cover-up regarding her fifth child. Fans <a href=#>have long suspected that Kailyn was pregnant</a>, and <a href=#>many subtle factors hinted she had a baby at home</a>, but she always denied it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Chris putting everything out there—good and bad—it seems like Kailyn can no longer deny that she has a fifth child (with a fourth baby daddy) with her latest beau, Elijah Scott.</p><p>Of course, she might be taking her time announcing the news on her own—if it's true!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqGcrrtuuM6wqbJlo5qws7HTZpmamqlisrl5waiwn6qZmrulew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
