They didn’t blow a bunch of smoke with new age platitudes, like Goop or now <a href=#>Jewel’s</a> ridiculous split statements. These two just were open and honest with the press (although they <a href=#>often overshared</a>) and worked to amicably coparent their daughter Coco, now 10. They’ve also stayed close, even while they’ve both moved on to other relationships. (The photos of them out shopping with their daughter are from June 12.)</p><p>A lot can change in four years of course. Just last week, Courteney announced her engagement to her lookalike boyfriend of about six months, Snow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid, 37. David has a two month old son with his girlfriend, ET correspondent Christina McLarty, whom he’s been dating for <a href=#>around three years</a>. Like Courteney, David is ready to make his relationship official. He just proposed to Christina at family dinner attended by his two month-old son, Charlie West, and daughter, Coco. In case this news makes it sound like David is rushing to beat Courteney to the altar, an insider tells US that he’s been planning to propose:</p><p>David Arquette is engaged! The actor popped the question to his girlfriend Christina McLarty in Malibu on July 2, Arquette’s rep confirms to Us Weekly…</p><p>The Scream star, 42, made the proposal a family event, a source tells Us. Arquette proposed to the entertainment reporter, 33, during dinner with their 2-month-old son, Charlie West, and Arquette and Cox’s 10-year-old daughter, Coco, at Mastro’s steakhouse in Malibu, Calif.</p><p>An insider tells Us Weekly Arquette had “planned it for a while” and has “known he wanted to marry Christina for a long time.”</p><p>In fact, the proposal just happened to fall near ex Cox’s engagement. “David was just waiting for the right time,” another source tells Us, “He and Courteney both talked about taking the next step in their relationships … They both want what’s best for each other.”</p><p>Arquette and McLarty have been dating on and off since 2011, briefly splitting in 2012. Arquette and Cox split in 2010, after nearly 11 years of marriage.</p><p><a href=#>[From US Weekly]</a></p><p>I get the feeling that David was hung up on Courteney for a while and now that she’s engaged he felt ready to take the next step in his own relationship. He’s been with Christina for so long that this engagement doesn’t seem reactionary to me, more like a natural decision for him. I could be wrong, and these two have had an on-off relationship as US mentions. Hopefully things are stable for them now and hopefully David is sober and ok. Congratulations to David and Christina!</p><p><a href=#><img alt="1 OAK Las Vegas Grand Opening Bash" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FFN_PerryKaty_Vegas_RIA_012812_8665577_edited-1-730x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt="Courteney Cox and David Arquette Reunite" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wenn21451538_edited-1-785x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt='2014 Indian Film Festival Of Los Angeles - Opening Night Screening Of "Sold"' src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FFN_Sold_Prem_AFP_040814_51378166_edited-1-766x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos of David and Christina are from 4-9-14, 1-11-14 and 1-28-12.
