The outtakes from these promos, where each star is just brandishing a green stick in an empty white room, have been making the rounds on the internet, and they’re glorious.
From Hilary Duff to Raven-Symoné, Us Weekly has rounded up the best — and most cringeworthy — clips from the famous kids who starred in your favorite childhood TV shows and movies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After repeatedly reciting a variant of the line, “Hey, I’m Hilary Duff from <i>Lizzie McGuire,</i> and you’re watching Disney Channel,” she seems to have had enough.</p><p>At one point, an offscreen voice — presumably that of the director’s — tells a wanly chuckling Duff to flash an even larger grin during one take and instructs her to be “real proud at the end” of her sentence. In response, Duff appears truly despondent — she looks down and quietly mutters “OK.” However, she finally nails it several times before being dismissed from the shoot.</p><p><b>Raven-Symone — <i>That’s So Raven</i>, <i>The Cheetah Girls</i></b></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Her face when they said “one more” @ 1:21? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/648OnEBR1R</a></p><p>— #JusticeForSexWithMe (@hollylikeablvd) <a href=#>November 15, 2016</a></p><p>Raven, bursting with confidence in a denim jumpsuit, brings a whole lot of personality to her taping. Despite her strong start, the actress — who played Raven Baxter on <i>That’s So Raven</i> from 2003 to 2007 and Galleria Garibaldi in the <i>Cheetah Girls</i> franchise — ran into a few problems: her “jacked” hair, her pace and a debate over whether she should say “Cheetah Girls” or “<i>The</i> Cheetah Girls.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/raven-symone-disney-zoom-5db56a25-816c-49f0-af5b-cedfff983b5c.jpg><p>When the director tells her to do it “one more” time at the 1:21 mark, she literally can’t even and serves a deadly amount of side-eye.</p><p><b>America Ferrera — <i>Gotta Kick It Up!</i></b></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>America Ferrera (aka Ugly Betty). She’s FAR from ugly & such a sweet girl ❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2cgh39FrQh</a></p><p>— #JusticeForSexWithMe (@hollylikeablvd) <a href=#>November 15, 2016</a></p><p><b>America Ferrera </b>— who played Yolanda “Yoli” Vargas in 2002’s <i>Gotta Kick It Up! </i>— pretty much kills it in every take even though she appears just a tad nervous. When the director tells her to do “one more” take, she fans herself and tells him, “Sorry, it’s really hot,” as she lets out an uncomfortable laugh.</p><p>When she films a few close-ups, she unfortunately has trouble remembering to say “hi,” when reciting the line, “Hi, I’m America from <i>Gotta Kick It Up!</i>, and you’re watching Disney Channel.” When given the correction, a smiley Ferrera graciously tells the director, “Oh, sorry, ‘kay.”</p><p>She eventually gets it just right during the very last take. Also, let’s please acknowledge Ferrera’s wand skills, because unlike Raven and especially Duff, she is a pro at drawing mouse ears in the air.</p><p><b>Lalaine – <i>Lizzie McGuire</i></b></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lalaine (Lizzie McGuire’s bff). The way she draws the logo has me dying ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/egbNABHTNq</a></p><p>— #JusticeForSexWithMe (@hollylikeablvd) <a href=#>November 15, 2016</a></p><p><b>Lalaine</b>, who played Lizzie McGuire’s BFF Miranda Sanchez, could have definitely benefited from a cup of coffee or a few Red Bulls prior to filming her promo. The director tells her to “have a little more passion” while drawing her mouse ears (a tip everyone could use aside from the artistically-inclined Ferrera, TBH) and also asks her to exert “a little more energy” when saying her line: “I’m Lalaine from <i>Lizzie McGuire,</i> and you’re watching Disney Channel.”</p><p>With each take, Lalaine’s enthusiasm increases, but the director tells her that she “needs to be real proud of [herself]” just like he told her costar Duff. Lalaine throws her arms and tells him, “I am!,” most likely inducing major secondhand embarrassment for anyone who watches this behind-the-scenes clip.</p><p>In an attempt to exude more pride, she raises her voice, adds in a few breathy giggles and even points to the camera. When she is told to say “hi” during her intro, she can’t help but let out a huge guffaw as she stumbles over the new line.</p><p>Maybe a little laugh is all Lalaine needed, because afterward, she seemed loosened up enough to deliver her most compelling take of all.</p><p><b>Steven Anthony Lawrence — <i>Even Stevens</i></b></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beans’s awkward lookin ass ?? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xqtG56SIm9</a></p><p>— #JusticeForSexWithMe (@hollylikeablvd) <a href=#>November 15, 2016</a></p><p><b>Steven Anthony Lawrence</b> played the adorably dorky Beans on <i>Even Stevens</i> from 2000 to 2003. In his promo, Lawrence regrettably trips on his words more than once — much like his character probably would.</p><p>However, he redeems himself by charming the director with his nerdy-yet-endearing delivery and tendency to say, “Ta-da!” after finishing his line: “Hi, I’m Steven Anthony Lawrence from <i>Even Stevens</i>, and you’re watching Disney Channel.”</p><p>Basically, Beans wins.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sadly, outtakes from Disney Channel’s biggest star, Hannah Montana, a.k.a. <b>Miley Cyrus</b>, haven’t been unearthed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6arJOdeqm1y5qpsmWUqrOnedGarZ6mXajGrrvNnqpmmaegxKK%2Bw2aboquemsZur8eapaednGK9s7vMqKpmr2RqfnGEl2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
