I grew up watching my Mom and Grandma spend hours in the kitchen baking for those they love. I would slip on my Mom’s red checkered apron, climb on the stool, and would gladly take my post as their official taste taster. I loved the feeling of being in the kitchen and wanted to be just like them when I grew up!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I would slip on my Mom’s red checkered apron, climb on the stool, and&nbsp;would gladly take my post as their official taste taster. I loved the feeling of being in the kitchen and wanted to be just like them when I grew up!</p><p>Fast forward to years later when I became old enough to bake on my own.&nbsp; It became something I literally asked my Mom if I could every single day. I would run home from school, scramble to finish my chores, open the cookbooks for inspiration, and get baking! I would get out all of Mom’s cookbooks, sprawl out on the family room floor, and start marking them up. For my 16th birthday, I literally asked for the “Search for the Best Chocolate Chip Cookie” Cookbook. True story. I still have the cookbook!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Almond-Poppyseed-Bread-7.jpg alt="Almond Poppyseed Bread.

I became a baking machine. It became one of the activities I loved to do the most with my kids. It was then that I started deviating from the cookbooks. I would analyze every recipe and wonder if I could tweak a few things to make it even better. This became my creative outlet!</p><p>This is what I love to do; it is what I crave. If I go on vacation and have been without a kitchen, I literally can’t wait to get back into the kitchen and bake up a storm! It is something I enjoy doing to relieve stress and just relax. Baking is an expression of love for me and it is one of the ways I show love to my kids.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Almond-Poppyseed-Bread-1.jpg alt="Almond Poppyseed Bread.

This is the month of gifting and baked goods are at the top of the list. I am always trying to figure out what to give my neighbors and friends during the Christmas season.&nbsp; This year the almond poppyseed loaf with sweet almond glaze and candied almonds won! It is always such a hit!</p><p>This almond poppyseed is so perfectly moist with the perfect balance of sweetness and nutty almond flavor. It is extra moist from a balance of three heavy hitters in the baking arena — butter, sour cream, and buttermilk. Each of them plays an important role in making the perfect almond loaf.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Almond-Poppyseed-Bread-3.jpg alt="Almond Poppyseed Bread.

This recipe won by a landslide because of its moist texture with just the right amount of sweetness.</p><p>I have always been a huge fan of using Nielsen-Massey products. I absolutely love their <span><a href=# rel=noopener>Pure Almond Extract</a></span>! They use as few ingredients as possible when producing their extracts to create the highest-quality product.&nbsp;Their Pure Almond Extract is made with the purest oil of bitter almond to deliver optimal results in flavor and quality.&nbsp;Also, all Nielsen-Massey products are all-natural, GMO-free, certified gluten-free, and allergen-free, which makes this mama happy!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Almond-Poppyseed-Bread-4.jpg alt="Almond Poppyseed Bread.

I tried this recipe is different pans to find out how the color affects it and it definitely becomes too brown on the edges. My favorite baking loaf pan is the <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B000OSNQXQ data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>NordicWare Loaf Pan</strong></span></a>.</li><li><strong>Spray the pan well with non-stick cooking spray</strong>. This bread removes pretty easily from the pan because of the butter content but I always like to give it a good spray to make sure it comes out nicely.</li><li><strong>Cream the butter, sugar, and eggs for 5-6 minutes</strong>, until the mixture is light and fluffy. This helps the sugars to dissolve but also whips air into the batter, which helps give the bread a nice rise.</li><li><strong>Use a combination of Buttermilk and Sour Cream to create a melt-in-your-mouth texture</strong>. Use Nielsen-Massey Pure Almond Extract for a natural almond flavor.</li><li>Bake at 325 for 35 minutes. <strong>Check the bread and if it is browning too quickly, carefully open the oven and lightly place a piece of foil</strong> over the bread.&nbsp; Keep baking for 10-20 minutes longer, depending on the depth of the pan.</li><li><strong>Let cool in loaf pan for 15-20 minutes</strong> before removing from the pan.</li><li><strong>Drizzle handcrafted vanilla bean glaze and candied almonds</strong>.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Almond-Poppyseed-Bread-Recipe.jpg alt="Almond Poppyseed Bread.
