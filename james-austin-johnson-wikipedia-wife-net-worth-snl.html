And that in 2019, on Mother’s Day, James instead of wishing his mother wrote “Happy Mother’s Day to my dad” on Instagram. From the look of it, he did so as some kind of a joke though.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, James seems to have brothers but it is not quite understood.</span></p><h3><b>James Austin Johnson Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>James Austin Johnson had above an estimated $600K net worth by Oct 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A Nashville native now living in Los Angeles, James is a comedian who has appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Future Man</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> on Hulu, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Robbie </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>on Comedy Central, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Last Tycoon</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> on Amazon, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Adam Ruins Everything</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> on truTV, and in the movie </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hail Caesar</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The last time we heard, James was performing weekly in Los Angeles at Highland Park’s longest-running comedy show, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rod Stewart Live</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>IMDB also credited him for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hail, Caesar!</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2016) and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Blue Like Jazz</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2012).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>James has had a lifetime of theatrical training. He was only 10 when he started acting. He studied the Sanford Meisner technique in college. Following this, he did many regular appearances as a stand-up comedian and podcast host, but none of these did more to put James on the map than his “Trump complains about Scooby-Doo” video.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>James started with direct mimicry, being openly racist and homophobic just as Trump is. But soon, he realized that people were listening and not liking what they were hearing from him. </span><span style=font-weight:400>“When I was repeating what Trump said or heightening it—making it more vicious to people, darker.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That is when James decided to pivot his famous not-written-out and not-rehearsed Trump impressions with a more abstract take.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In the meantime, fans eagerly wait for James to be on SNL alongside two other cast members:</span><a href=#> <span style=font-weight:400>Aristotle Athari</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and</span><a href=#> <span style=font-weight:400>Sarah Sherman</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>James Austin Johnson Wife</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>James Austin Johnson cried for the first time in life on the day he married his beloved wife Rebebka Lain.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, James and Rebebka have been married since November 2018. And a year before their Nashville, Tennessee wedding Rebebka had said yes to marrying James.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Speaking of how they met, the pair had gotten together for good after four years of silence on 5 October 2016.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lately on 19 September 2021, James also subtly revealed that he and his wife and number one whiner are expecting their “whiner number two this holiday season”.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/James-Austin-Johnson-Wife-300x222.jpg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now that you are already mostly aware of James, you may peek into some of Rebebka’s life on her Instagram and Pinterest @rebabka.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Professionally, she seems to be a baker.
