The answer is that it depends on the state's NIL rules, but generally, non-student athletes may find it challenging to get NIL deals due to their lack of exposure and fame.</p><p>NIL deals have been a hot topic in the sports world since July 2021 when the NCAA changed its rules, allowing <a href=#>college athletes</a> to profit from their name, image, and likeness. This decision has led to Spencer Rattler, the former quarterback for Oklahoma, signing a historic deal with Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, worth $1.4 million. Rattler's deal has set a new standard for what <a href=#>college athletes</a> can earn from their NIL, and many other college athletes have also signed significant deals. However, while college athletes have a platform to showcase their skills and exposure to a broader audience, non-student athletes may not have the same opportunities.</p><p>The issue is that over 60% of NIL deals have gone to college football players, leaving athletes in non-revenue sports struggling to earn money from their name, image, and likeness. Non-student athletes may not have the same level of fame and exposure as college <a href=#>athletes</a>, making it difficult for them to attract companies' attention. However, there are still opportunities for non-student athletes to make money from their NIL.</p><p>One way non-student athletes can make money from their NIL is through social media content. Social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube provide opportunities for non-student athletes to showcase their skills and build a following. By creating engaging content, non-student athletes can attract followers and potentially monetize their accounts. They can also partner with local businesses and create a brand to increase their exposure and attract more opportunities.</p><p>Another way non-student athletes can make money from their NIL is by partnering with their teammates for deals. This can be a great way to leverage each other's following and increase exposure to potential sponsors. Additionally, non-student athletes can reach out to brands and businesses and offer their services in exchange for compensation or exposure.</p><p>It's also essential for non-student athletes to engage with businesses and perform acts of kindness to grow their following. By engaging with businesses and performing acts of kindness, non-student <a href=#>athletes</a> can attract more followers and increase their exposure. This can lead to more opportunities to make money from their NIL.</p><p>It's worth noting that NIL deals are expressly prohibited from rewarding compensation to a college athlete for their performance on the field]. This means that non-student athletes cannot receive compensation for their performance in any sports event. However, they can still make money from their name, image, and likeness in other ways.</p><p>In conclusion, non-student athletes may find it challenging to get NIL deals due to their lack of exposure and fame. However, there are still opportunities for non-student athletes to make money from their name, image, and likeness. By leveraging social media, partnering with local businesses, creating a brand, teaming up with teammates, and being proactive in reaching out to brands and businesses, non-student athletes can increase their <a href=#>exposure</a> and attract more opportunities. It's also important for non-student athletes to engage with businesses and perform acts of kindness to grow their following. While it may not be easy, non-student athletes can still monetize their NIL and potentially transform the way we think about sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6cmKdlnqS7br%2FTrpuepqRirrW0y56rnqtdnLK1ec2io2aclZa5tA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
