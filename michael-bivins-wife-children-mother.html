Records have it that he was born on August 10, 1968, in Boston, Massachusetts, which is also where he was raised. The singer was born to Shirley and Gerard Bivins; he is not their only child as he has a sister named <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Teasha Bivins.</span></p><p>Much is yet to be learned about his upbringing just as his career has cast a shadow over his family life. Nonetheless, it is said that Michael Bivins is very fond of his mother who taught him how to be diligent with his works. He also has a good relationship with his father even though the man didn’t live with his family. He was always busy with his work in the Navy. Michael’s parents never got married.</p><p>Apart from the family he hails from, he has built one with his wife, <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Teasha Bivins. It was on the 14th of October 2006 that the couple got married.&nbsp;</span>Michael and Teasha’s union has been blessed with four daughters thus far: Savannah, Shilah, Starlah, and Sanaah Bivins. The singer has a son named Michael Bivins, Jr. from another relationship before he got married to Teasha.</p><h2><strong>Revenue From Record Sales Laid The Foundation for Michael Bivins Net Worth of $40 Million</strong></h2><p>With the many years he has been active in the music industry, it comes as no surprise that Michael Bivins has an extensive body of work. He began his career as one of the founding members of New Edition. The American R&B/pop group has released seven studio albums, two holiday albums, and eight compilations.</p><p>Apart from their first album, Candy Girl, the rest received certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America. Their 1984 album New Edition, Heart Break (1988), and Home Again (1996) were all certified platinum twice. In all, it is estimated that New Edition has sold over 20 million records across the globe.</p><p>When New Edition went on hiatus in 1989, Bivins teamed up with Ricky Bell and Ronnie DeVoe to form Bell Biv DeVoe (BBD). This music group has released four studio albums thus far and has equally sold millions of records.</p><p>Their debut studio album titled Poison was released in March 1990 and went on to pull platinum certification four times. In all, New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe have made millions of dollars from record sales. It was through this that Bivin first became a millionaire.</p><h3><strong>Is He The Richest Member of New Edition?</strong></h3><p>The original lineup of New Edition consisted of Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Bobby Brown, Ronnie DeVoe, Johnny Gill, and Ralph Tresvant. Due to behavioral problems, other members voted Brown out in December 1985.</p><p>He would embark on a solo career and record a huge breakthrough that reportedly made lead singer Ralph Tresvant consider a solo career as well. It was around this time that Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe voted Johnny Gill into the group.</p><p>Michael Bivins is the richest member of New Edition. This is so because he has not limited himself to only being a music artist. He works in other areas of the entertainment industry and capitalized on his fame to build other lucrative ventures. Below is a look at his net worth compared to other members of New Edition.</p><ul><li><strong>Michael Bivins’ Net Worth</strong> – $40 Million</li><li><strong>Ricky Bell’s Net Worth</strong> – $15 Million</li><li><strong>Bobby Brown’s Net Worth</strong> – $2 Million</li><li><strong>Ronnie DeVoe’s Net Worth</strong> – $15 Million</li><li><strong>Johnny Gill’s Net Worth</strong> – $10 Million</li><li><strong>Ralph Tresvant’s Net Worth</strong> – $8 Million</li></ul><h2><strong>Michael Bivins Works As a Music Manager and It Has Been a Cash Cow for Him&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Rather than just working with his musical groups, Bivins has involved himself in other areas of the music business. He is a music entrepreneur who serves as the A&R personnel of his music groups. More than that, he is known to look out for talented individuals to manage, alongside producing for other acts. This has been a steady source of income for Bivins.</p><p>It is said that the salary of music managers in the United States of America <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>ranges from $16,338 to $440,037</a>. Most managers prefer to take commission, a percentage of the income the artist they manage generates. While the percentage is negotiable, it is usually around 15 and 20 percent. Considering the crop of acts Michael Bivins has worked with over the years, it is not difficult to see how this has been a huge source of income for him.</p><h3><strong>What Artists Has Michael Bivins Managed?</strong></h3><p>One of the things that have stood Michael Bivins apart from other members of his music group is the successes he has recorded with developing new acts. As a music manager, he has worked with many music artists over time. Some of the most popular ones are listed below:</p><ul><li>Subway</li><li>Mc Brains</li><li>Val Young</li><li>Another Bad Creation</li><li>Yvette Nicole Brown</li><li>702</li><li>Boyz II Men</li><li>Hayden</li><li>P-Nutt</li><li>Lil’ Nique & DJ Jus</li></ul><h3><strong>The Music Manager Made Good Money From Biv 10 Records Which He Founded</strong></h3><p>It was sometime in 1992 that Michael Bivins founded his record label, Biv 10 Records. From what we gathered, it was created as a joint venture with Motown Records. It started as Biv Entertainment and recorded multiple successes working with Motown.</p><p>Because of this, Motown helped Bivins to create his own imprint rebranded as Biv 10 Records. This afforded him more creative freedom to work with artists and he would go on to record some success with acts like 702 and Subway.</p><p>While he never pulled any significant success with the label before it was dismantled in 2012 and folded into Motown, one can’t deny he made good money from the venture. The financial records of the label have never been disclosed to the public but there are no doubts that Biv 10 Records was profitable, at least for a while, and contributed a meaningful amount to Michael Bivin’s $40 million net worth.</p><h2><strong>Michael Bivins’ Net Worth Sources Also Include His Career In The Movie Industry</strong></h2><p>The music artist from Boston isn’t the first to crossover to the movie industry from music and he wouldn’t be the last.
