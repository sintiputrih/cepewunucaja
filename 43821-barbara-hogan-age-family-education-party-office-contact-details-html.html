The apartheid government confined her in solitary for a year after interrogation and ill-treatment. Consequently, she became the first South African woman to be found guilty of high treason, and she had to serve ten years sentence in prison.</p><p class=align-left>Eventually, Barbara was released alongside notable political prisoners like former President Nelson Mandela in 1990.
