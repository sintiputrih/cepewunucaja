&#34;The only problem — his hairy armpits! We take only mostly shaved guys. He should also focus on his diet to help him get a bit harder. He doesn't have to go the fitness-y hard look, but he could tighten up a little bit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We take only mostly shaved guys. He should also focus on his diet to help him get a bit harder. He doesn't have to go the fitness-y hard look, but he could tighten up a little bit. His body is a little soft. But he has good hair and a great face. He's definitely Chippendales material. Anytime he wants to do the show, he's more than welcome!"</p><p><strong>Playgirl writer Jamye Waxman</strong>:<br>"As a woman, I think the shots are tasteful, but of course, I would have loved to have seen it all! I think it's hard to get a 19-year-old to do 'sexy' and really get it. At 19, you know how to show off your still-tight body, but do you actually know how to use your sexuality? I feel like you really develop your sexual energy and attitude in your 20s and 30s, so Levi has a way to go before he's completely comfortable in his body. He doesn't have much chest hair, does he? I like a bit more chest hair."<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Jim McBride, creator of MrSkin.com</strong>:<br>"I do appreciate the tan lines. That look takes me back to my secret Playboy collection from the '70s."</p><p><strong>David Leddick, author of Nude Male and Escort: 40 Profiles with Photographs of Men Who Sell Sex</strong>:<br>"My book Escort features guys who are selling their bodies. Levi has a nice body, but he's not in that league at all. He doesn't have what it takes to get $150 an hour. His best feature is his face. He has something in his face. Were I Levi, I'd want to be an actor for camera, not stage. I'd pursue a career in acting. If he's got the right management, he should try to act. He's not so different from <strong>Clark Gable</strong>, <strong>Gary Cooper</strong> — a lot of major stars who didn't come from a superior background. He's got something — you can go all the way with a great face."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Edward Norwick, general manager of New York City's Scores strip club</strong>:<br>"I've seen a lot of naked women, and I could see a woman in those poses with those facial looks. His expressions are a little effeminate. I would have approached it with a more macho image, not quite as sensitive. His head is turned coyly to the camera with doe eyes! I had hoped for his first shoot, it would be a little more rugged — a man's man. A little more like Burt Reynolds."</p><p><strong>David Todd, Men's Director, Nous Model Management:</strong><br>"He's a great looking young man, but he definitely needs to slim down more if he wants to sign with a high-fashion agency. He’s got to get those cheekbones showing, he's got to get his body toned down. You have to be at least six feet [tall] or six-one for high-fashion [modeling]. Levi might go more towards commercial print, maybe endorsing a product, like Axe cologne or something like that, instead of doing a huge print campaign for Tom Ford."</p><p><strong>Jon Barrett, editor-in- chief of <a href=#>The Advocate</a></strong>:<br>"He has such a lumberjack-like persona in clothes that I expected to see more of that — including the log — in the Playgirl pics. Instead, we see a Levi who's playing a coy game of peek-a-boo. This is certainly no 'northern exposure.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJmlvaa6w5qjnqtdorylsctmmqiloKGuqrrSZpibp6Wpeq2x1aJko6eYo8C1u82sZKGZmafGbq3RpqeirKNif3F8mGtqamlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
