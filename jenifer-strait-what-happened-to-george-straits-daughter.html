Her very special love of all though was her brother Bubba.”</p><p>“To watch them together, and the way she watched over him made us know he was always safe with her, no matter what. He loved her back in the same way, and always will, just as we always will. She was like a second mother to Bubba in a way. They had their arguments like brother, and sister do but in the end she always made Bubba feel like he came out on top.”</p><p>“Her cousins Shane, Wade, Kara, Trey and Walker were also special to her. There was always closeness between them that I don’t ever remember having when I was young. They all love each other very much. We will all miss Jenifer very much, and we will never forget her, her smile, and laugh.” Jenifer’s death affected her family and loved ones.</p><p><strong>ALSO, READ:</strong> <a href=#>Bubba Strait: Facts About George Strait’s Son</a></p><p>Jenifer’s father George Strait revealed that he became “real private” after he lost his daughter”.
