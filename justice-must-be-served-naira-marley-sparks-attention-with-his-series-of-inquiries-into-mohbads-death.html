I’ve been deeply hurt. But let’s do this for Mohbad; I know the internet can help. Let’s shed light on this matter for Imole. Where did he go? Who took him there? Who were the people he was with? Who was he last seen with? What was the nurse treating? Why was there no autopsy? Why was he buried so quickly and in such a manner? Who paid Instablog9ja to claim it was an ear infection first? We owe this to Imole. Light will always prevail over darkness,” Naira Marley expressed.</p><p>He added, “They are trying to hide the truth by paying bloggers. Let’s show them that their money is wasted. Many of his friends know exactly what happened to him. Why are they scared to speak up?
