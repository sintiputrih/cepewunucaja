Some anime are bigger than others, like My Hero Academia and Sailor Moon, but even less popular shows have dedicated fanbases, like A Lull in the Sea and The Ambition of Oda Nobuna. Anime fans come from all walks of life, so it makes sense that there would be such a vast array of content for them to enjoy.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=560 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Now, some people might think it’s weird to find animated characters attractive, but others have been crushing on their favorite cartoon characters since they were kids. (Danny Phantom, anyone?) It’s not surprising that people find their favorite characters attractive, which is why we’ve put together a list of the top 15 hottest guys that anime lovers have collectively fawned over. Bear in mind that there may be some spoilers in the explanations for what these guys are doing here, so proceed with caution if you have yet to see each show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>15. Light from Death Note</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/death-note.png><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Light’s obvious god complex in the primary <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Note adaptation</a> doesn’t make him an obvious choice for an attractive character, but he has many other qualities that are hard to ignore. His intelligence and confidence are enough to make anyone swoon. Consumed with boredom, Light takes advantage of the titular Death Note. When it falls into his hands, anyone he names on the document will die.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>His intentions are good, and wants to make the world a better place, but his collaboration with the demon Ryuk sends him down a dark path. However far he goes in creating a worldwide massacre, it is impossible not to admire his intelligence. His ability to play cat and mouse with the authorities and ultimately be worshipped as a god is a seductive quality.</p><h2 id=h-14-levi-ackerman-from-attack-on-titan data-injectable=false>14. Levi Ackerman from Attack on Titan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Levi.jpeg><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Levi is one of those characters whose cold persona doesn’t make him very approachable. It would seem that his looks are the main reason so many people love him. He’s very respectable, and respects others he deems worthy, but isn’t opposed to ignoring those he doesn’t. Though he can be seen as emotionless, Levi is also incredibly empathetic and cares about others’ safety and well-being.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>After finding out that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all types of Titans</a> could have been humans, he was a wreck and unsure of how to handle the idea that he’d been killing humans all this time. Levi is a complex character with many different attributes, but even just looking at him, it’s no surprise that he made the list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>13. Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tuxedo-mask.png><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>A classic character from one of the most famous anime series, Tuxedo Mask is the main romantic interest in Sailor Moon. Also known as Mamoru Chiba, Tuxedo Mask is the Sailor Guardians’ frequent collaborator in saving the world from evil. Though he first appears to be emotionally distant or even cold, it is all hiding his inner pain.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>A trademark trope of any YA series, Tuxedo Mask mysteriously helps Sailor Moon as they fall in love. He is also a benchmark for how heroes are supposed to behave. Even though his motives appear mysterious at times, his intentions are always pure. He is the ideal boyfriend for any teenager, and eventually marries the object of his affection. Dedicated to saving the world, Tuxedo Mask is the ideal partner.</p><h2 id=h-12-spike-spiegel-from-cowboy-bebop data-injectable=false>12. Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Spike.png><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>From Cowboy Bebop, we have Spike Spiegel, who’s made a bit of a comeback over the past few years. Whether it’s his curly locks or the cool way he talks, everyone seems to have a thing for him, even those who have never even watched his show. Netflix’s live-action adaptation brought a new interpretation of the character to screens with John Cho in the role, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the show wasn’t well-received by fans</a>.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Spike is a bounty hunter with a mysterious past, so he’s already got the mystery part going for him. Other than that, though, he’s a calm, cool, and collected guy that spends his days not bounty hunting, but watching TV and taking naps. He’s the definition of a cool guy and has everyone fawning over him because of it.</p><h2 id=h-11-izumi-miyamura-from-horimiya data-injectable=false>11. Izumi Miyamura from Horimiya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Miyamura.jpeg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>When Horimiya first aired, half of the internet went crazy over Miyamura’s design. He was a hot new alternative guy with plenty of piercings. So why is he so low on the list? Unfortunately for us fans of the alt look, Miyamura loses the piercings and cuts his hair a little less than halfway through the series, so we lost out on a big part of what made him so physically attractive.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>Miyamura is a quiet student who hides who he really is from his classmates, which is the basic premise of Horimiya in the first place. Eventually, he lets his guard down and starts to make friends and reveal his true nature to them. He’s a sweet and genuine guy who anyone would be lucky to date and he works at a bakery, so free snacks! Miyamura is more “normal” than some of the other guys on this list, but it doesn’t make him any less great.</p><h2 id=h-10-satoru-gojo-from-jujutsu-kaisen data-injectable=false>10. Satoru Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Satoru-Gojo.jpeg><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>Something about guys with white hair just hits different to anime fans. It’s unclear if it’s because white is a color we’re not used to seeing or if the white-haired anime guys really are just the best, but this list definitely proves that something’s going on. Gojo’s bright blue eyes are a stark contrast to his hair and pale skin, which immediately makes him stand out.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>His personality is a complex one, as he’s a teacher to students. And while he’s playful with them, any adult he sees as weak might as well get out of his sight. Since he, much like the rest of the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, has a desire for power and believes himself to be nearly invincible, he can be seen as arrogant, which he probably wouldn’t refute.</p><h2 id=h-9-ayato-sakamaki-from-diabolik-lovers data-injectable=false>9. Ayato Sakamaki from Diabolik Lovers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anime.png><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=899 data-injectable=true>Anyone who’s ever watched Diabolik Lovers knows that none of the vampires are exactly “good” people, per se, but it doesn’t mean they’re not hot. Bad guys are hot, after all — that’s just the way it is — and vampires are no exception. The biggest problem with Ayato is that he’s kind of predatory, but it’s in more of a bloodlust way than a sexual way. While it’s problematic, it’s all for the sake of plot and character development, so we’ll allow it.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Ayato seems to be the “main” brother in Diabolik Lovers as we see him go through the biggest development in his relationship with Yui. He might be a jerk, but he does save her life multiple times, even though he refuses to admit he has any feelings for her. It’s a cute cat-and-mouse dynamic that continues well into the second season.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Kaji from Neon Genesis: Evangelion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sesshomaru-1.png><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>In a series full of mysteries, Kaji is one of the biggest. Virtually every main character keeps some sort of secret, and this mystery makes Kaji one of Neon Genesis: Evnagelion’s most desirable characters. Though not a large pool to pick from — no one is asking Gendo Ikari for his number — Kaji’s affability makes him fascinating.</p><p data-characters=723 data-current-count=1062 data-injectable=true>Initially introduced as an agent for NERV, audiences later learn he also works for SEELE. Ultimately, Kaji’s allegiances are proven to be true to Shinji. A surrogate father figure to both him and Asuka, Kaji is the direct opposite of Gendo. Not only does he end up being a kind person, but he is also the cad of the series. As Misato’s former lover, the two continue to engage in flirtation — as he does with effectively every adult female working at NERV. His desirability is made all the more tragic by his demise in the final episodes. After his subterfuge as a triple agent is discovered, Kaji is assassinated, which devastates Misato. As it goes with many anime series, the good ones are always the first to die.</p><h2 id=h-7-sesshomaru-from-inuyasha data-injectable=false>7. Sesshomaru from Inuyasha</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kyo.jpeg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Sesshomaru is a demon of few words and is technically considered a villain, but he’s hot all the same. Choosing between him and Inuyasha was difficult, but who doesn’t love a bad boy? Sesshomaru is a full-fledged demon who hates practically everyone else in the show, except for a young human girl, Rin.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>In Inuyasha‘s sequel series, Yashahime, we see that Sesshomaru eventually marries and has children with Rin. Even in the sequel, though, he seems to be just as cold, quiet, and mysterious as ever. Whether it be his voice, his design, or his lack of personality, Sesshomaru has made an everlasting impression on Inuyasha fans.</p><h2 id=h-6-kyo-sohma-from-fruits-basket data-injectable=false>6. Kyo Sohma from Fruits Basket</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tomoe.png><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Fruits Basket is an extremely popular anime that originally aired in 2001 and received a reboot in 2019. Fans of the original series were thrilled, and a lot of it had to do with this guy right here, Kyo Sohma. Kyo is the bad boy delinquent with anger issues, so you can imagine how many people fawned over him. Other characters tend to shy away from him because of his harsh exterior, but not Tohru. She’s the only person who sees through his exterior.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Kyo is part of a curse that makes it hard to be with the one he loves, so even as he starts to fall in love with Tohru, he refuses to admit it. He pushes her away and tries to do what’s best for her, fearing his dark destiny. Kyo almost always has good intentions with the people he cares about, he’s just not the best at explaining that.</p><h2 id=h-5-tomoe-from-kamisama-kiss data-injectable=false>5. Tomoe from Kamisama Kiss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usui.png><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>One of the more stubborn guys on here is Tomoe from Kamisama Kiss. Being a demon, he is proud, seductive, and doesn’t like humans. However, he is tricked into a contract with the new land God, Nanami, a normal teenage girl. For most of the first season, Tomoe does the bare minimum to serve her, but she slowly falls in love with him and even admits her feelings, which results in him having to save her. After that, things slowly begin to change for the better.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Kamisama Kiss and Tomoe are great examples of people becoming better versions of themselves. He becomes more compassionate and considerate of Nanami’s feelings and grows protective rather than just feeling obligated to protect her. Besides that, we also have the natural demonic charm that comes with the white hair. Even before he comes around for Nanami, Tomoe has that stubborn and arrogant charm that people love to hate.</p><h2 id=h-4-takami-usui-from-maid-sama data-injectable=false>4. Takami Usui from Maid Sama!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aki.png><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>Anyone who’s watched Maid Sama! knows that Takami Usui is one of the best anime guys ever. He was almost number one, but he does have some alarming moments throughout the series. Usui goes after what he wants, and in the series, that’s Misaki Ayuzawa, the student body president who the entire school is afraid of. All the girls have crushes on Usui, but his sights become set on Ayuzawa after he discovers she secretly works in a maid cafe to make money for her family.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>The two are complete opposites, but throughout the series we see Usui begin to take responsibility for himself and his actions thanks to the budding relationship between the two. Like Tomoe, it’s great proof that the right person can help someone grow into a better version of themselves. So while Usui is definitely physically attractive, by the middle of the series he’s also perfect boyfriend material.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. <strong>Aki Hayakawa from Chainsaw Man</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zero.png><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>In contrast to many of the teenage characters stumbling through life as devil hunters, Aki is the opposite. Since his brother was killed by the Gun Devil when they were children, Aki had only one goal in mind. Uninterested in anything that would get in his way, he has little interest in the Chainsaw Man himself, Denji.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Aki’s devotion and focus on his goal is admirable, as his self-sacrifice. He is so consumed with finding his prey, that he even sacrifices his life to the Future Devil to get an edge on his enemies. These qualities would be impressive on their own, but no one can deny what his combat skills bring to the mix. Aki’s emotional maturity and swordsmanship would make anyone feel protected, and that is an attractive trait. Unshakeable in his beliefs, the devil hunter can always be depended on to get the job done.</p><h2 id=h-2-zero-kiryu-from-vampire-knight data-injectable=false>2. Zero Kiryu from Vampire Knight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/roy-mustang.png><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Not only is Zero Kiryu incredibly loyal, but he’s the perfect strong and silent type. For anyone who has watched Vampire Knight, it was always a choice between Zero and the pureblooded vampire, Kaname. The main character, Yuki, had to choose between them and definitely made the wrong one.</p><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Zero was willing to do almost anything for her, including leaving to keep her safe. Yuki, though, ended up choosing Kaname after some disturbing revelations. Zero is one of those guys with a shell you’d have to break him out of, but it would be worth it. He has strong feelings for the few people he cares about and will protect them with his life. He goes through a lot over the course of the series, but through it all his main priority is to protect the one he loves. Even after Yuki chooses another man, Zero still swears to protect her. He’s nearly perfect.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. Roy Mustang from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>The shining gem in the crown of anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood fires on all cylinders. Between story and characters, there is a reason why fans keep coming back to the series time and time again. And that doesn’t have just to do with Edward and Alphonse Elric’s bid to reclaim their bodies. Roy Mustang is intent on winning Amestris back from the clutches of Fuhrer King Bradley. It isn’t just his strength of character that makes him attractive, however, but his passion.</p><p data-characters=703 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=false>Known for his flame alchemy and signature ignition cloth gloves, Roy is one of the most powerful and skilled alchemists. Largely defined by his cunning and reserved nature, he is a force to be reckoned with. Ever since the homunculus Lust killed his best friend, Hughes, Roy would do anything to avenge him. He finally gets his chance with deadly results. At first, it seems like Lust gets the better of him with her razor-sharp talons, and even she is shocked when Roy comes back to finish the job. Cauterizing his wound with his own flame alchemy, he burns her again and again until there is nothing left. His physical prowess and unrelenting force make him the most admirable character in the series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lmKTBtbHSrWSappmism6z1LKqZqeWYq6tuIytoKadXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
