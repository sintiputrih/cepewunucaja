Hoffman posted a series of photos on his Instagram but the very first one clearly gave the news away."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hoffman is married?</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Lamon Archery’s daughter’s opinion on his new look</a></p><p>“If you didn’t know I was married you’re not the only one,” he stated. “Some people at the baby shower didn’t even know we had gotten married!” Though he admitted that being private about his personal life is something that he has no trouble doing on social media, Hoffman expressed, “But I’m just so excited for us I had to share!”</p><p>So, how long have he and his beautiful wife been married? “Ida and I were married in the beginning of the pandemic on March 13, 2020,” he revealed. “We had a little ceremony in Santa Monica but have not had a big wedding yet.” Wow, for over two years the actor was able to keep that little tidbit under wraps — that in itself deserves a big congrats!</p><p>He went on to say that Ida is “the greatest thing that ever happened to [him],” and he’s “truly honored to be starting a family” with her.</p><p>From all of us at Soaps.com to you both, we wish you a lifetime of happiness and are so excited for the upcoming birth of your first child!</p><p><b>Take a look at our gallery below filled with over 30 photos of other <i>Days of Our Lives</i> <a href=# rel=noopener>stars and their real-life partners</a>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19rf3qClWpmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BMq5ymoZ6cwbC6jKGmn56dlrtuucCrqaKdlGKyubzEnKuippdir6Ku2Gauop6VYralrY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
