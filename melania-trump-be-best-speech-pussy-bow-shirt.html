Which adults are you referring to, Melania?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SAUL LOEB/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “In today’s global society, social media is an inevitable part of our children’s daily lives. It can be used in many positive ways, but can also be destructive and harmful when used incorrectly. This is why Be Best chooses to focus on the importance of teaching our next generation how to conduct themselves safely and in a positive manner in an online setting.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Melania’s Communications Director Stephanie Grisham maintains that she operates completely independently from Donald — and that her speeches and wardrobe choices shouldn’t be read into — it’s tough not to interpret the First Lady’s message as a direct blow to the traits her husband has become known for (read: aggressive tweeting).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, her actions — and fashion — prove that often, she intentionally goes against what Donald wants. A recent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a> profile, for instance, suggests that Melania wore that now-infamous “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>I Really Don’t Care, Do U?</a>” jacket to visit migrant detention facilities as a response to critics who disliked the idea of her traveling to meet families despite Trump’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> points out, Trump has often worn items that call attention to the things her husband hates. After news of the Stormy Daniels scandal broke, Melania wore a white pantsuit at the 2018 State of the Union, a look that resembled something Donald’s former political opponent Hillary Clinton would wear. And the same week that Access Hollywood released tapes of the president talking about grabbing women "by the pussy," Melania emerged in a pink pussy-bow Gucci shirt at a presidential debate in October 2016.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>AFP/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Which brings us to Monday’s outfit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to dismissing negative behavior on social media during her “Be Best” speech, Melania dressed conservatively but also put forth an item she doesn’t wear regularly: the pussy-bow blouse. She styled it with black slacks, pointed-toe pumps, and an over-the-shoulder black blazer, making the lavender shade of her top stand out from everything else. Could she have worn it to suggest that it’s Donald, not anyone else, not children, that should refine his “destructive” social media habits? Maybe.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grisham (her spokesperson), however, already debunked any connection between her comments and the actions of the president. CNN’s Kate Bennett directly asked her about the irony of the situation, to which she replied, “She’s addressed this before. She is well aware of the criticism, but that will not deter her from doing what she feels is right.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I would hope most people in this country are proud that they have a strong and independent First Lady who only has the best interests of children at heart — I know I am,” Grisham continued. Independent? It certainly sounds like she and Donald continue to live in a house divided.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGedmrmiusiaZK2qpaK9bq7EZpmeq6RiwLGxxJyfZqilqMC6ecGormarmJ6%2FtQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
