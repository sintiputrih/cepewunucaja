He would invite every roar from the crowd that made it to his family’s Magnolia, Mississippi home, about 2-3 minutes from South Pike High School.</p><p>For the Eagles’ third-round draft pick, that was about the extent of his high school football career.</p><p>Taylor, the linebacker whom the Eagles drafted with pick No. 103 on Friday night, was not allowed to play high school football because of his mother’s religious beliefs. They were members of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, which didn’t allow Taylor to participate in sporting events from Friday night through Sunday morning.</p><p>Taylor loved football but wasn’t able to suit up. So before games, he’d sometimes clean the field, picking up water bottles and litter. And then he’d be stuck in his house, listening to the sounds of football, hoping to one day get a chance to play.</p><p>Taylor, now 21, decided to give football a real try after he turned 18. He tried out for the football team at Coahoma Community College. Taylor said he prayed on it; if he made the team, he’d play football; if he didn’t make the team; he wouldn’t.</p><p>Taylor made the team. And after two years at the JUCO program and two years at Colorado, he became a third-round linebacker with a ton of upside.</p><p>And with a lot of work left to do.</p><p>“We’re not drafting this guy in the third round because we don’t think he’s going to be a serious contributor in his rookie contract,” GM Howie Roseman said about the athletic linebacker. “We’re certainly hoping that he’s going to get out on the field as quickly as possible. The defensive staff coach is really excited about him, and we also think he can be a difference-maker on special teams.”</p><p>It’s easy to see why the Eagles are intrigued by him. VP of player personnel Andy Weidl saw Taylor play against Oregon and his speed jumped out. Taylor ran a 4.49 at the combine and then ran a 4.39 at his pro day.</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Davion Taylor</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-davion-taylor></span><span>Who is Davion Taylor?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Davion Taylor is an American football linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL) who was born on August 5, 1998, in McComb, Mississippi, United States.
