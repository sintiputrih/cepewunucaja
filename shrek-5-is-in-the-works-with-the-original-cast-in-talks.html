The original cast is a huge part of that.”</p><p>As of Tuesday, Meledandri, 63, said there are no firm deals with Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz or Eddie Murphy but negotiations were being held.</p><p>“We anticipate the cast coming back. Talks are starting now, and every indication that we’ve gotten is there’s tremendous enthusiasm on behalf of the actors to return,” gushed Meledandri.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">While both Myers and Diaz have yet to make an official statement, Eddie Murphy has expressed his desire to reprise his role as Shrek’s faithful donkey sidekick. <span class=credit>©DreamWorks/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>The Post reached out to Myers, Diaz and Murphy for comment.</p><p>Released in 2001, the original “Shrek” film grossed nearly $492 million at the box office and spawned three other films and several spin-offs.</p><p>The franchise later became a pop-culture staple and spawned several memes and iconic moments including a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cover of Bonnie Tyler’s “Holding Out for a Hero.”</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">As of Tuesday, there are no firm deals with Myers, Diaz or Murphy but negotiations were being held. <span class=credit>©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>While both Myers and Diaz have yet to make an official statement, Murphy has expressed his desire to reprise his role as Shrek’s faithful donkey sidekick.</p><p>“If [DreamWorks] ever came with another ‘Shrek,’ I’d do it in two seconds. I love Donkey,” said Murphy, 62, in a January interview <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>. “They did&nbsp;‘Puss in Boots’&nbsp;movies. I was like, ‘They should have done a Donkey movie. Donkey is funnier than Puss in Boots.’ I mean, I love Puss in Boots, but he ain’t funny as the Donkey.”</p><p>According to the outlet, Meledandri was reportedly “thrilled” with Murphy’s comments.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Released in 2001, the original “Shrek” film grossed nearly $492 million at the box office and spawned three other films and several spin-offs. <span class=credit>©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>“It’s evidence of his strong enthusiasm for a role that he so brilliantly inhabited and really created alongside the artists at DreamWorks. I found that comment to be very exciting.”</p><p>Meledandri also teased the possibility that Donkey might get his own spin-off films.</p><p>Several Twitter users went nuts when the news broke.</p><p>“EVERYONE GET UP REAL CINEMA IS BACK,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> one user.</p><p>“We will all be watching,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said </a>a second person.</p><p>“I’m gonna cryyyyy this is so great,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gushed</a> a third person.</p><p>As of Tuesday, there have been no plot details or release announced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21maWxfqLWzscpmbGaho2K2r3nToZxmr5%2BnuLR51qKroWWknbJuu9GinqKmkaF6pK3SrWSipl2prq230mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
