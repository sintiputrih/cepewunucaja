Valentine’s Day is about one month away, so it’s officially time to think about what to wear out to a steak dinner with your boo (or around the house if you’re lucky enough to have a home-cooked meal). Deciding what to don for the day of Xs and Os can be a challenge; on one hand, you want to look cute and trendy — but you also need to be comfortable."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Deciding what to don for the day of Xs and Os can be a challenge; on one hand, you want to look cute and trendy — but you also need to be comfortable. This is especially important when embarking on a surprise activity with your special someone.</p><p>But choosing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an outfit</a> doesn’t have to be stressful! While there are an overwhelming number of options to wear, layering is key. We found a Valentine’s Day outfit that offers the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ideal balance</a> of festive, comfortable and practical. Plus, it’s versatile enough to wear throughout the winter season. You’ll be rocking this trendy heart cardigan for V-Day and beyond!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Verdusa Long Sleeve Print Button Knit Cardigan Sweater </a>for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication but are subject to change.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A V-neck design is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ideal set-up</a> to layer with a tank underneath; buttons yield plenty of styling scenarios. You can wear the sweater fully open in the front, closed, off the shoulder, half-buttoned, tucked in and any other way your fashion heart desires. The sleeves loosely cuff comfortably at the wrists, but you can switch up your aesthetic by half-rolling or scrunching-up sleeves. This will give you a casual vibe while keeping your style chic — which is key!</p><p>Made of 100% polyester, the cardigan sweater is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">extra stretchy</a>, soft, smooth and gentle on the skin. In other words, scratchy is the opposite of this garment! Reviewers adore the feel of the necessary knit, along with the ability to wear it across seasons, one even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sharing</a> a great idea to “convert summer dresses into fall outfits” by simply adding this garment. Love it!</p><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4109Kkz30tL._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$36</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li></ul><p>Cue the heart eyes emoji, because this sweater is a sensation for Valentine’s Day and beyond!</p><p>The oversized fit is extra flattering and especially practical on a day when lots of chocolates, carbs and heavy foods are to be expected (and encouraged).</p><p>There are seven heart sweater variations, coming in colors like pink, white, brown and black, among others — with some boasting different heart patterns. We particularly love the lighter colors as they can play up your tan depending on your skin tone, but choose whichever you like best!</p><p>Keep in mind that Valentine’s Day is, after all, about who you are on the inside and expressing love — so don’t overthink your appearance too, too much (we’re human though, so we get it!). Luckily, this sweater makes it easy to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">show your love</a> while looking totally fashionable in the process!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Verdusa Long Sleeve Print Button Knit Cardigan Sweater </a>for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon!
