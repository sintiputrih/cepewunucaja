But his rise to basketball fame hasn’t come without its challenges."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Because he’s spent his entire life under a microscope, Zaire’s no stranger to the scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye.</p><p>“I would say it's getting a little easier as I get older — just dealing with the naysayers,” Zaire told Distractify exclusively.</p><p>The athlete opened up about his years-long mission to live up to critics’ expectations.</p><p>“I would say my whole life — it’s been that comparison [and] battle between, you know, either trying to be better to him or exactly like him,” he went on. Looking back, he knows that his efforts were made in vain.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dwyane Wade (@wade_legacy)</a></p></figure><p>“The way I look at it now is that it's not fair to anybody — especially not me trying to chase my own dreams," the athlete added.</p><p>“If [fans] were in my shoes, I feel like they would instantly understand why they shouldn't be comparing me or saying certain things that they do,” Zaire continued. “But I feel like the reason that they are is because they're not.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zaire Wade debunks the biggest misconceptions about his dad: "People have the wrong image of him."</h2><p>If there’s one person who truly gets what Zaire's going through, it's his dad.
