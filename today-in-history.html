After years of harsh suppression by the Polish government, Solidarity finally led to the removal of Soviet influence and opened up the country to semi-free elections.</p><h2>2006: Cassie Jo Stoddart Is Killed In The “Scream Murder”</h2><p>High school student <a href=# rel=noopener>Cassie Jo Stoddart</a> is stabbed to death by her classmates Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik in their small Idaho town.
