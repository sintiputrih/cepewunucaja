While they <a href=#>have not confirmed the speculation</a>, they have not necessarily denied it either.</p><p>“I think that everything you need to know is on camera,” the hunky actor told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> in January 2021 with a laugh. “That’s why we presented it so beautifully for you, and all of the sparks that flew came off of the beautiful scripts that we were handed. And so, I think that the sparky words, scripts and material are more than enough.”</p><p>The Waterloo Road alum, for her part, revealed that she and Page <a href=#>have stayed in touch</a> since they wrapped filming, though they have not been able to see each other in person in a while.</p><p>“Unfortunately now he’s off in Los Angeles, but we check in with each other a lot,” she told <a href=#>The Guardian</a> later in January, adding that they “spent so much time rehearsing together that we’ve become good mates.”</p><p>Dynevor hopes to reunite with the Roots alum — and the rest of their castmates — as soon as possible, however.&nbsp;“I’m sure Daphne will end up getting involved [in the next story line],” she said, noting that season 2 will follow Daphne’s brother Anthony Bridgerton (<strong>Jonathan</strong> <strong>Bailey</strong>), who is the main character in the second book in <strong>Julia Quinn</strong>’s series. “But yeah, I do wonder what it looks like. I’m excited to find out.”</p><p><strong>Chris Van Dusen</strong>, who created the <a href=#><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a>-produced show, also wants to see the characters continue to develop on the small screen.</p><p>“Obviously, we’re just focused on the first season right now,” he told <a href=#>Cosmopolitan UK</a> in December. “And while that focuses on the eldest Bridgerton daughter, Daphne, and her love affair with Simon, we know there are eight Bridgerton siblings [and] there are eight Bridgerton books.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In January 2023, Dynevor confirmed that she wouldn’t be reprising her role of Daphne Bridgerton in season 3 of the hit Netflix series. “Sadly not in season 3. Potentially in the future,” she told Screen Rant at the time, when asked about future “exciting dynamics” for her character in the upcoming episodes. “But season 3, I’m just excited to watch as a viewer.”</p><p>Scroll down to find out what we know about the cast’s offscreen dating histories:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7O1w6Ccq6yfo3qkrdKtqmackam2r7OMoaCsrJ%2Bntqa%2FjKmfqJ2Smnqlxc2eraiqXaeyqLGMo5yapl2lrqixjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
