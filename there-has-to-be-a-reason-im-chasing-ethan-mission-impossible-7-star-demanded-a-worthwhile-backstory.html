For example, Shea Whigham’s Briggs, the government agent in charge of neutralizing Hunt, simply shows up in the franchise with an unexplained beef.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>However, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with SlashFilm</a>, Whigham teased that answers may be on the way in Part Two:</p><p>“I told them that there has to be a reason why I’m chasing [Ethan]. Otherwise, it’s not going to play for two and a half hours, to have egg on my face in every country, that I just miss him. So I just wanted to ratchet that up without explaining anything. I didn’t want to explain it, other than going into, possibly, the next one. But also, man, I wanted to honor the Midnight Run of it all, The Fugitive of it all. I’m big on paying homage to films that I love, and so we sprinkled some of that in there and I just wanted to make Briggs a wild card. By any means possible, he’d tried to take Ethan in, with it being real and personal underneath.”</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Cards on the table, Dead Reckoning was the first Mission: Impossible I’ve seen since III back in 2006. I’ll catch up, but when Briggs showed up with no explanation as to why he has a bone to pick with Hunt, I assumed that he was a returning character from a previous movie.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Whether we ever learn Briggs’ true motivation in a future movie or not, the world is now eager to see how this sci-fi Hideo Kojima-esque espionage adventure plays out. Sadly we may have to wait a little longer than expected, as production on Part Two is currently on hold due to the Hollywood strikes.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is scheduled for release on June 28, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6Gdopp6qa3SZquoZZKaeqJ50Z6YrKeeYrauecKhmKyhnpx6psDHmqVmpZmowKq7zWagpqifqMCqrsueZHBlo6mus3nDnqSappSasW6tjLCmq6yYrLWquMRmmZqbm6jBsL7YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
