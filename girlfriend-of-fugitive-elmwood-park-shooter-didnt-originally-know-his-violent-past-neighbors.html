He&nbsp;wanted to fly to Las Vegas to marry the victim and needed legal advice about what he said was a pending criminal case in New Jersey, prosecutors said at the time.</p><p>As the two men spoke, the victim mouthed the words "no, no, no" to Cochran's female assistant. Allan was then convinced to go to Des Moines police.</p><p>Jurors convicted Allan of illegal gun possession, criminal restraint and violating a domestic violence restraining order, among other counts.</p><p>He was sentenced in July 2002 to 10 years in prison, four of which he'd have to serve before being eligible for parole.&nbsp;It's believed he ended up serving six after initially being denied release.</p><p><strong>SEE:&nbsp;<a href=#>JAMES ALLAN v. NEW JERSEY STATE PAROLE BOARD</a></strong></p><p>What role Greco might have played in any possible conflict between Dolack and Allandale wasn’t immediately clear. The women had worked together at HUMC and have been friends for some time.</p><p>A friend of both women said Greco was "trying to protect Lisa" when authorities said she was shot at Dolack’s home in the 100 block of Lincoln Avenue shortly before 5:30 p.m. Dec. 27.</p><p>Authorities didn't way what type of weapon was used. Friends said Greco was shot in the head three times, leading to speculation that it may have been an airsoft or other non-lethal type of gun.</p><p>Police found Greco a short time later at a 7-Eleven on Broadway (Route 4) in Fair Lawn about two miles away. It was unclear whether she or someone else drove her there.</p><p>Greco, who'd just turned 63 on Christmas Day,&nbsp;was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center with injuries that a source with direct knowledge of the incident said weren’t considered life-threatening.</p><p>Allandale&nbsp;fled the home in a white pickup truck that police found abandoned hours later along Route 20 in Paterson.</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Saddle Brook-Elmwood Park and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBko52iqLK6e9Kam52klZe%2FsLvKaKWer6NktKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqwsoyfrKChpJ7DpnnEpaSwp5%2BZerGt0aRkrKCfpMGmvoydoJ2mpGK8s7XGoqWapJyueqy6zrBkoaGjYsOqu8uepa1loJbAtXnNnqCgoJKkv7R7l25pcW1hZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
