Warner Bros. Pictures carved out a particular continuity for the Justice League through the DC Universe Animated Original Movies (DCUAOM.)</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>The DCUAOM began in earnest in 2007, building on the solid foundations of Batman: The Animated Series and its spin-offs and movies. Unfortunately kicking off with the Man of Steel’s darkest hour in Superman: Doomsday, the DCUAOM quickly strengthened the roster with Justice League: The New Frontier. Within three stories, it had set a new continuity which stands as the longest and most consistent way of catching up with Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, et al in feature film form.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>We’ve listed exactly how you can watch every Justice League movie in order of release. Don’t expect the continuity to make total sense as it leaps between versions and format, but do expect the adventures of the mightiest heroes on Earth and beyond.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League of America </strong><strong>(1997)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>This TV movie was a pilot for a CBS series that never materialized. Justice League of America will seem strange to many viewers who are more familiar with the Justice League’s later screen appearances. It concentrated on a less familiar incarnation of the heroes taking on the villainous Weatherman to save the city of New Metro. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman escaped this underpowered production, but Green Lantern, Atom, and the Flash weren’t so lucky. Consider it a palette cleanser.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League: The New Frontier </strong><strong>(2008)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Picking up from writer and artist Darwyn Cooke’s 2004 graphic novel, the DCAU chose a Silver-meets-Golden Age origin story to kick off its Justice League adventure. Justice League: The New Frontier was the animated feature debut for big-hitters like Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths (2010)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>The Justice League’s second appearance, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, drew on the comic arc Crisis on Earth-Three! and the graphic novel JLA: Earth 2 ,as the superteam clashed with their inverted counterparts, the Crime Syndicate.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League: Doom </strong><strong>(2010)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Justice League: Doom is a sequel to Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths reworked comic arc JLA: Tower of Babel, and pits the heroes against the Legion of Doom led by immortal villain Vandal Savage.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox </strong><strong>(2013)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>An adaptation of the huge comic series that demonstrated just how dangerous the Flash’s powers could be, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox used the ready-made reset of Flashpoint and Barry Allen’s misplaced attempt to save his mother to create a new sub-continuity: the DC Animated Movie Universe (DCAMU.)</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League: War </strong><strong>(2014)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Justice League: War doesn’t hang around setting up the overarching threat of the new DCAMU.

The Trinity of the League dance around each other in Zack Snyder’s dark and brutal telling of how the League came to be. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will be remembered for many things other than what it got right and the fact that the trilogy Snyder intended never concluded.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice stands out in this list for presenting a dystopic DC universe even before the dystopia arrives. If you like your Wonder Woman lonely, your Batman particularly obsessive, and your Superman at his most inspirational when he’s dead, this is the version for you.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League Vs.

Justice League Dark features Batman joining forces with the supernatural equivalent of the Justice League to combat a mystical threat. Making his first appearance in the Justice League feature films was Matt Ryan’s John Constantine, who stars alongside the likes of Zatanna and Swamp Thing.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Justice League </strong><strong>(2017)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=true>The live action version of the Justice League finally made it to the screen with a big budget, dream cast, and crushing disappointment. The return of Superman was botched in a skimmed-down, poorly rendered, and frustratingly light film that wasn’t the meeting of Earth and Apokolips fans had spent years wishing for. The failure of the Justice League feature film resulted in the live-action DC Extended Universe grounding to a halt, and it’s hard not to think the animated equivalent didn’t take quick notes so it could round out its story more satisfactorily.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>The Death Of Superman</strong><strong> (2018)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>In the wake of Justice League, it was time for the DCAMU to tackle the infamous storyline that saw the Last Son of Krypton fall at the rocky hands of Doomsday and the surviving members of the Justice League deal with the consequences.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Reign Of The Supermen </strong><strong>(2019)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Where there’s a Death of Superman, there’s a return.

Out of nowhere, Warner Brothers announced and released this original extended vision of Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which expanded the team, increased the threat, and at least partially made up for the pain of the Joss Whedon directed 2017 Justice League.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>DC League of Super-Pets</strong><strong> (2022)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>DC League of Super-Pets stepped away from the other continuities and, as it stands, is the Justice League’s last appearance on the big screen. When the Justice League once again shows off its skill for being abducted, it’s down to their super pets to save the day. The film stars Dwayne Johnson as Krypto the Superdog; Kevin Hart as Ace the Bat-Hound; and Vaness Bayer as PB the size-changing pet of Wonder Woman.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>A cameo by Black Adam handed Dwayne Johnson three roles in DC League of Super-Pets, helpfully summing up DC adaptations’ current state of flux. We don’t know if any of these stories will continue in their current form, but while we wait, at least there’s a goldmine of Justice League features to keep you busy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZZGhuW7Ax55ko62jqbaksYylnJqfpZp6rrvVopysZZmjerC%2Bw56paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
