Anna herself died in 2007.</p><p>So just how rich was Anna Nicole Smith? Sources estimate that Anna had a net worth which at the time of her death was over $50 million, earned through acting, modeling and appearing on various television shows, plus inheritance.</p><h3>Anna Nicole Smith Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>Anna Nicole was raised largely by her aunt in Mexia, Texas, attending the local high school but dropping-out at 16. She met and married her first husband a year later, when he was 16 and they were working at Jim’s Krispy Fried Chicken in Mexia. They had a son a year later and separated a year after that. Anna Nicole worked at Wal-Mart, and as a waitress before she became a stripper, and in 1991 she began taking modeling and voice lessons, shortly after which she auditioned for ‘Playboy’ magazine.</p><p>Anna Nicole became famous and her net worth jumped significantly after she became a model for ‘Playboy’ magazine. However, she also became known for her somewhat deviant behaviour. Being 24 years old she posed for ‘Playboy’ magazine, and attracted the attention of Paul Marciano who made Nicole a jeans model. This contract increased Anna Nicole’s net worth significantly, however she also continued working with ‘Playboy’ which increased her popularity, too. In 1993, Anna Nicole Smith was&nbsp; Playboy’s Playmate of the Year.</p><p>A year later Anna Nicole decided to try acting and appeared in films ‘The Hudsucker Proxy’ directed by Joel Coen, ‘Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult’ written and directed by David Zucker, ‘To the Limit’ directed by Raymond Martino, and ‘Skyscraper’ directed by Raymond Martino. She also took part in&nbsp; episodes of television series including ‘Sin City Spectacular’, ‘Ally McBeal’, ‘NYUK’ and others. In 2002, Anna Nicole Smith net worth jumped when the reality show about her daily life called ‘The Anna Nicole Show’ was broadcast. Furthermore, Anna Nicole was starred in ‘Wasabi Tuna’ directed by Lee Friedlander, in which she characterized herself, and had a cameo role in the&nbsp; film directed by <a href=#>F. Gary Gray</a> ‘Be Cool’, that added to Smith’s net worth as well.</p><p>In her less than private personal life, married twice, firstly to Billy Smith as mentioned above, at then at twenty-six years old Anna Nicole Smith married her second husband, billionaire <a href=#>J. Howard Marshall II</a>, who was eighty-nine years old at the time of marriage. Smith declared that she loved her husband though during their marriage she allegedly had a number of affairs with celebrities including Clay Spires, <a href=#>Scott Baio</a>, Clay Spires, Jonathan McManus, <a href=#>Larry Birkhead</a> (DNA establishing him as her daughter’s father) and others. Her second husband died in 2006, leaving Anna&nbsp; pregnant with her daughter <a href=#>Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern</a>, who DNR tests later proved paternity to <a href=#>Howard K. Stern</a>, the attorney. Five months later, Anna Nicole Smith was found dead in a hotel room after overdosing on prescribed drugs.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=35.070615034169><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Anna Nicole Smith</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 28, 1967, Mexia, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>February 8, 2007, Hollywood, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Stripper, Adult model, Model, Actress</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Durkee Elementary School, Mexia High School, Aldine Intermediate School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>J.
