His brother, Kevin, also pursued a career in acting and screenwriting.</p><p>O’Neal attended University High School in Los Angeles, where he trained to become a Golden Gloves boxer. In the late 1950s, his father’s job as a writer on the television series Citizen Soldier led the family to Munich, where O’Neal attended Munich American High School.</p><p>In 1964, O’Neal secured the role of Rodney Harrington on the popular ABC nighttime soap opera Peyton Place. This role catapulted his career to new heights.

O’Neal secured the role because the studio was seeking a young actor similar to Doug McClure. The show achieved great success, propelling its cast, including O’Neal, to national recognition. Many of the cast members, such as Mia Farrow and Barbara Parkins, were offered movie roles. O’Neal himself was eager to venture into the world of films. While working on Peyton Place, O’Neal also appeared in a pilot episode for a potential series called European Eye in 1968. Additionally, he signed a recording contract with ABC. O’Neal’s first leading role in a feature film came in 1969 with The Big Bounce, which was based on an Elmore Leonard novel. That same year, he also appeared in a television adaptation of Under the Yum Yum Tree (1963).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Originally, O’Neal was intended to star in Bogdanovich’s unsuccessful musical At Long Last Love but was ultimately replaced by Burt Reynolds. However, he did collaborate with Reynolds, Bogdanovich, and his daughter Tatum O’Neal in the screwball comedy Nickelodeon (1976), for which he received a fee of $750,000. Unfortunately, the film did not fare well at the box office. O’Neal then took on a minor role in the star-studded war film A Bridge Too Far (1977), portraying General James Gavin. Despite O’Neal’s portrayal being criticized, it is worth noting that he was only one year older than Gavin during the events depicted in the film. While the movie performed poorly in the US, it found success in Europe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-ryan-o-neal-net-worth><strong>What is Ryan O’Neal Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>The actor, with a flourishing acting career, has appeared in more than 500 TV episodes and numerous successful movies.
