She called it a “excruciatingly painful” time in her life when speaking to The Christian Post. However, after the couple had worked to repair their marriage, they reaffirmed their vows a little over a year later.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In an interview with CP, she said she hopes to show how God’s faithfulness has carried her through “even in the midst of really deep heartbreak” by passing on the insights and life experience she’s gathered.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Ricky Martin Divorce: Is Jwan Yosef Still Married to Him?</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What Was the Cause of Seperation?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The 52-year-old woman claims that her husband “broke those vows” despite the fact that they renewed their marriage vows three years ago following a “painful separation.” “It has crushed my heart to know he has broken those vows,” she wrote.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Over the past several years, I have fought really hard to not just save my marriage, but to survive the devastation of what consistent deception of one spouse does to the other. It’s brutal and heart crushing to constantly fear the hurtful choices of someone you love. I’ve had to learn the hard way there’s a big difference between mistakes (which we all make) and chosen patterns of behavior that dishonor God and the biblical covenant of marriage.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>“While there is clear biblical justification for my decision to end this marriage, I am choosing to hold most of the details private out of respect for our children and grandchildren, and to give space and privacy for my family and me to continue to heal,” she wrote.</p><p><img alt="Is Lysa Terkeurst Still Married" width=660 height=365 sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Is-Lysa-Terkeurst-Still-Married-2-660x365.png></p><p style=text-align:justify>TerKeurst told that at the time that even though the struggle for their marriage was&nbsp; “so, so hard,” it was “one we want to do.” “And we want to give it the necessary time so that trust can be rebuilt, and trust takes an incredible amount of time,” she said.</p><p style=text-align:justify>TerKeurst has been vocal about the pain she endured as a result of her husband’s infidelity and how God has been with her through it all.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I would just encourage anybody who’s walking through stuff — there’s someone else who needs to hear your story,” she said in a 2021 interview. “I think everyone has life wisdom, evidence of God’s faithfulness and experiences. … And I think when we share our stories, if we focus on those things rather than the details of how we were hurt, that’s where it becomes really helpful for other people.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Bitterness and resentment could be eating me alive.
