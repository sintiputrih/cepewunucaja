During a 13 March 2014 podcast of The Briefing, Mohler stated that Evangelicals “simply cannot accept the legitimacy of the papacy” and that “to do otherwise would be to compromise biblical truth and reverse the Reformation.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=albert-mohler-calvinism></span><span>Albert Mohler Calvinism</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mohler, as a Calvinist, believes that human salvation is a free gift from God that cannot be earned by human action or will and is only given to the elect. He has publicly advanced this position with respect to Judaism, Islam as well as Catholicism.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=albert-mohler-library></span><span>Albert Mohler Library</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mohler’s book, He Is Not Silent: Preaching in a Postmodern World, became the one-millionth item collected in The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary’s James P. Boyce Centennial Library. The occasion was recognized with a special presentation in the chapel.</p><p>“There is a happy coincidence in that with the publication of Dr. Mohler’s book, the library has achieved the milestone of its one-millionth item,” Bruce Keisling, associate vice president for academic resources and seminary librarian, said as he presented Mohler with a framed print of the seminary and certificate marking the book’s receipt in the library.</p><p>“We want to acknowledge and celebrate this joint milestone of the library’s accomplishment, which is really represented in the stewardship of Southern Baptists throughout many generations,” Keisling said. “But we want to recognize this joint milestone of Dr. Mohler and the library.” Mohler urged students as well as faculty to reflect on the significance of so many items being collected in one theological library.</p><p>“One million items—that’s just an incredible hallmark as not only will the seminary be celebrating its sesquicentennial in the year 2009, but that library, in terms of the building, will be celebrating its 50th birthday as well,” Mohler said, noting that the library was built in 1959 on the seminary’s 100th birthday.</p><p>Mohler predicted that the greatest accomplishments of the library are still in the future. “Under the wonderful leadership of Bruce Keisling, it’s going on to even greater heights of service,” he said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=albert-mohler-church></span><span>Albert Mohler Church</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In early 2019, the Southern Baptist Convention was shaken by explosive newspaper reports of sexual abuse by church leaders as well as volunteers, and Mohler called for independent investigations by third parties. Just days after the year 2019 Houston Chronicle report of allegations of hundreds of cases of sexual abuse (some of which were not reported to law enforcement officers), Mohler apologized in a newspaper interview for supporting a religious leader accused of helping to conceal sexual abuse in his former church.</p><p>Some lauded Mohler, while others questioned these comments ‘ timing and motivations. One day after Mohler’s remarks to the Houston Chronicle, his Southern Baptist Theological Seminary office released a related statement by him.</p><p>Mohler believes that the Roman Catholic Church is a “false church” teaching a “false gospel” as well as the office of the pope is not legitimate. During a podcast of The Briefing on 13 March 2014, Mohler said that Evangelicals “simply can not accept the papacy’s legitimacy” and that “doing otherwise would be compromising biblical truth as well as reversing the Reformation.”</p><p>Mohler said he was one of the original signatories of the Manhattan Declaration because it is a limited ecumenical statement of Christian conviction on the subjects of abortion, euthanasia as well as gay marriage, and not a broad theological document that undermines confessional integrity. He stressed that, despite his profound theological disagreements with the Catholic Church, he signed the document.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=albert-mohler-leadership></span><span>Albert Mohler Leadership</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mohler has denounced Pope Francis for his perceived left-leaning leadership.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=albert-mohler-reading-list></span><span>Albert Mohler Reading List</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>H.
