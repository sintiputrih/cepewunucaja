She is his first child and was born to the Hip-Hop star and his high school sweetheart Toya Johnson on 29 November 1998. Lately though in addition to being kenned because of her famous father, Reginae is also known for playing out her relationship with Ar’mon Warren on a WeTV show called&nbsp;Toya and Reginae. This show which kicked off on 24 August 2023 follows Reginae and her mom Toya as they let cameras in on their real lives. Because we get to see the relationship between Reginae and Ar’mon on the show, we bring to you a tell-all writing about&nbsp;Ar’mon. Here’s everything you need to know about him.</p><h3><strong>Ar’mon Warren Girlfriend: Is He Still Dating Reginae Carter?</strong></h3><p>Episode 1 Toya and Reginae of the show documented Reginae and Ar’mon together as they hit some issues in their relationship, having just had planned a move together. Nevertheless, they were together around this time. Fast forward to today though, they were no longer a couple. Speaking on Fox 5 on 24 August 2023, Reginae explained that she is now officially “single”. While also admitting “Ar’mon is hot,” she confirmed that they are no longer together. She also assured her well-wishers that she was doing well. Earlier, in May, she detailed in a live video why she broke up with him. She explained why she felt “live-bombed” by her ex-boyfriend. Seemingly hurt, she also discussed how he did not check on her when her home was burglarized. Instead, according to her, he was busy making a YouTube video. Around this time, Ar’mon too was throwing jabs at each other. Their breakup was clearly a messier one.</p><p>At the time of this writing, Reginae and Ar’mon no longer followed one another on social media. 24-year-old Reginae, at this point, continued doing what she usually does as an actress, rapper, singer, and social media star. As of now, she also was a member of the group “OMG Girlz” alongside Zonnique Pullins (Tiny Harris’ daughter).</p><p>And then just in April 2023, these two exes also had shut down speculations about domestic violence. Reginae literally dispelled in a TikTok Live that it was Ar’mon but herself responsible for her hand injury.</p><p>Until actually December 2023 the estranged couple was seemingly manifesting marriage in the future. Around this time, Ar’mon also was recorded addressing DJ Akademiks calling his girlfriend at the time “a b**ch.”</p><p>They both also occasionally documented their romance on social media. They showed people as they exchanged gifts on Christmas Eve. In all those years they dated, they celebrated their anniversary on December 25th.
