For videos that were released soon after he had shaved his head, he even added hair using photoshop in order to maintain the constant style. The correct thumbnail, at least according to MrBeast, is worth $10,000.

I hate this extension, as I have sold my soul to the devil that is mrbeast. 10 stars if possible.”</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
