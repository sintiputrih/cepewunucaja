Bow Wow has a lot to answer for after his ex-girlfriend Kiyomi Leslie accused him of causing her miscarriage. Kiyomi went on a Twitter rampage blasting the “Growing Up Hip Hop” star for subjecting her to domestic abuse during their relationship. Among other things, she claimed he punched her pregnant stomach and resulting to the loss of her unborn child."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Footage of that fight was later released on revealing Bow Wow being aggressive with his Kiyomi. They were both charged with battery for that incident.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>"She ain’t have no scars on her. I don’t think y ‘all really understand this girl went through my s–t."</strong></h3><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>BOW WOW ABSOLVES HIMSELF OF GUILT</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>In a recent episode of “Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta,” Bow Wow defended his actions that day by saying it was him who was the victim. He admitted to cursing Kiyomi but not laying a hand on her.</p><p class=dh>“I didn’t touch her. My face was f–ked up,” Bow Wow <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/By-QiFWjp_g/?utm_source=ig_embed">said</a>, seemingly justifying his behavior. “She ain’t have no scars on her.

She said she didn’t reveal her bruises on TV but the police have proof. She likewise dragged Bow Wow’s family and accused them of demeaning her.

There’s no reason you should be that close cussing someone out if you don’t want to fight.

So this is what you do?” he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/By-X9uvgVNJ/?utm_source=ig_embed">writes</a> and reveals a woman was responsible when he later adds, “Come on girl.”</p><p class=dh>It’s unclear who the woman is but it’s certainly someone who hates him enough to do that. Could it be Kiyomi still? Or another woman who shares her sentiments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpscnFlbnqju9Zmrqivo2KyuXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKSgsqednnqtsdKloJ5lo5bGb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
