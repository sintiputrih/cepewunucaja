Here’s what 10 of the most memorable girls have been doing since their episodes aired!</p><img decoding=async width=800 height=449 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-9.46.49-AM.png alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-12 at 9.46.49 AM" image-id=15658441 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=wp-caption-text>Twitter @Cashhhhh_; Instagram @summerr15; @kristinamariehead; @jordan_zeplin</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title">Ebony Jackson (Season 1)</h4><p class=wp-caption-text id=caption>Source: Instagram @mami_eby</p><p>Ebony Jackson appeared on 16 and Pregnant’s first season when she was 17 years old. She and her fiancé Josh both planned to join the Air Force upon their graduation from high school, but when Ebony got pregnant their plans were put on hold. The young couple tied the knot shortly after the birth of their child, Jocelyn, and Josh enlisted in the Air Force, while Ebony revised her plan to accommodate motherhood.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title">Ebony Now!</h4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.teenmomtalknow.com/wp-content/uploads/screen-shot-2016-11-20-at-2.22.29-pm.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=wp-caption-text id=caption>Source: Instagram @mami_eby</p><p>Since their appearance on the show, things went south for Ebony and Josh. In 2011, the couple was arrested and Jocelyn was taken from them by Child Protective Services due to “untenable living conditions.” Ebony and Josh eventually won back custody of Jocelyn and had another child, Jayden, before splitting in 2013. Ebony is now dating James Baldrick and the couple welcomed their first child together, Jaelyn, in June of 2015.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.teenmomtalknow.com/wp-content/uploads/14956437_10153966539426630_8854232145924894689_n.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=wp-caption-text id=caption>Source: Facebook @Lori Wickelhaus</p><p>Lori’s episode was one of the more emotionally charged hours of TV 16 and Pregnant put on the air. She and her then-boyfriend, Cory, were pressured by their parents to put their child up for adoption, through the young couple agreed that they were ill-equipped to raise a child of their own. After their baby was born, he was adopted and the pair split shortly after.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmam5dlrulec%2BrnKCmkaPBbsPHnqmeZZGnsm7Ax56wZqafrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
