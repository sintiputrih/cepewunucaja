People also seem to like African safaris. I’ve been on three this year alone! What if we blended those two things together?”
And then a studio executive shrugged his shoulders and lit his cigar with a $100 bill, which is the same thing as a green light when it comes to an Adam Sandler film."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That seems rather promising until you get further down his curriculum vitae and notice that he also directed Sandler in&nbsp;Click, which is so titled because that is what you would do if you ever accidentally came across that movie on cable.&nbsp;Click.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Just to give you a little bit of hope about the film’s quality that will later be crushed mercilessly and leave you broken and crying in the gutter,&nbsp;Blended will also star some actors you probably wouldn’t mind seeing in a movie. There’s Joel McHale of&nbsp;Community and&nbsp;The Soup and&nbsp;Terry Crews of&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine Nine, and let’s face it, they’re both going to go to waste here.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Look, let’s not mince words: Adam Sandler has been in some pretty abysmal movies in the last few years. Yeah, he was good in&nbsp;Funny People, but that was directed by Judd Apatow, who managed to even make Katherine Heigl&nbsp;seem moderately funny. Frank Coraci, in case you didn’t read it two paragraphs ago, directed&nbsp;Click.</p><p data-characters=6 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Click.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>But if you didn’t learn your lesson from&nbsp;Grown Ups&nbsp;or&nbsp;Jack and Jill or&nbsp;That’s My Boy or&nbsp;Grown Ups 2, then you’re probably never going to learn. Go ahead and watch the trailer for&nbsp;<strong>Blended</strong> below. The movie’s coming out on May 23, 2014 and unfortunately, it will probably make a lot of money.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomaWdnpmypXnTq5iipJWneqKwwKZkrJmembmmvoydqZ6vXZeus77YpqarnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
