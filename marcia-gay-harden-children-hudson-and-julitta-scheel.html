And before that, we saw him on RuPaul’s show with his mum and twin sister. He talked fondly of his mum and his sister. Of course, before that RuPaul introduced him as a budding Hollywood makeup artist and an aspiring YouTube star. Yet, later, Hudson kind of corrected the host that YouTube is not his calling and he is more headed towards broadway.
