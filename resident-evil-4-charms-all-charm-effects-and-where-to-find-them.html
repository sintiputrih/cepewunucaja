This case brings back the delicate balance of managing your inventory space between <a href=#>healing items</a>, ammo, weapons, and other items that you want to bring with you. What’s new are the little keychains you can attach to your case called Charms. These are more than minor cosmetic flair, though, as each Charm has a unique buff that can help turn the tides in your favor. However, being brand new, even veterans of the survival horror classic won’t know how to get or use them immediately. Leon needs every advantage he can get in Resident Evil 4 remake, so help him out by checking out all the Charm effects and where to find them.</p><h2>How to get Charms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>Since Charms are a new addition in the remake of <a href=# data-injected=1>Resident Evil 4</a>, the way to get them is also somewhat new. Those who played the original might recall a small shooting range Leon could mess around in. In the remake, this mini-game has been expanded quite a bit. There are now multiple shooting ranges and within them multiple challenges. The first one you can encounter is when you find the Merchant in Chapter 3 after going through the Quarry. Whichever shooting range you pick, enter the ornate elevator to be transported to the range.</p><p>Shooting range challenges will rank you based on your score, and depending on what you get, reward you with either a silver or gold token (if you score high enough, of course). These tokens are what you will turn in to get yourself charms.</p><p>The downside is the system for getting Charms isn’t as easy as a shop where you can trade in your coins for the Charm of your choice. Instead, you will insert them into a machine that will randomly spit out a Charm. The only small influence you have is based on what tokens you insert, as you must put in at least three tokens. That means there are four possible token combinations you can use:</p><ul><li>3 gold tokens</li><li>2 gold and 1 silver token</li><li>1 gold and 2 silver tokens</li><li>3 silver tokens</li></ul><p>While there are some conflicting reports, it does seem as though the more valuable combinations — three gold tokens or two gold and one silver — have a better chance of a higher tier Charm payout, but your mileage may vary. What is known is that what Charms you get are set once you start your playthrough. What this means is you can’t “save scum” the system to get what you want since reloading a save before inserting your tokens will always yield the same Charm.</p><h2>How to equip Charms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Once you’ve got one or more Charms unlocked, you can attach up to three of them to your attaché case of choice. To do this, simply go to the Customize Case&nbsp;tab in the typewriter menu and select the Charms you want to equip from the menu below. You can swap them out at any typewriter, so feel free to change them out to suit your current needs.</p><h2>All Charms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There are over 30 Charms in Resident Evil 4 remake if you include the two that are only given as DLC bonus items for those who purchased the Deluxe Edition.
