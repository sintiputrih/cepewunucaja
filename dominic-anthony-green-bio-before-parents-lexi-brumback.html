His Bio, Before</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-04-16</div><p><span>Dominic Anthony Green is a pansexual trans man who is popular for documenting his honest progress as a transgender male. Moreover, he went on to date the </span><i><span>Cheer</span></i><span> star, Lexi Brumback. Need we explain more why this handsome man was in the spotlight when the Netflix show season 2 premiered in Jan 2022?</span></p><p><span>This Dominic Anthony Green Bio explores everything you need to know about him.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Dominic Anthony Green, Lexi Brumback Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>According to his Facebook, Dominic Anthony Green was engaged to Lexis Brumback in mid-2019. Or at least this was what his Facebook profile said. However, we’re pretty sure that by “engaged,” he referred to the start of their relationship.</span></p><p><span>The two first appeared over Dominic IG in June that year (chilling at a beach).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since then, the lovebirds were inseparable. They often appeared together over several events, including the </span><i><span>Night Night</span></i><span> movie premiere in Dec 2021.</span></p><p><span>According to Dominic, Lexi was an “amazing soul” who accepted him despite his not so well-accepted identity. “She’s shown me how much she cares about the trans community by standing up for me and still standing with me, these are things she doesn’t have to do,” he shared.</span></p><p><span>Before dating the actress, Dominic also dated a girl named Tanna Nicole. Also, the two were quite popular among the fans. What’s more, they even had a Twitter fan account @</span><a href=#><span>tannicfanpage</span></a><span>, dedicated to their love life.</span></p><h3><b>Dominic Anthony Green Before Surgery</b></h3><p><span>Dominic Anthony Green looked just like any other average teen girl before surgery.

And considering his fanbase, he raised enough.</span></p><p><span>By 18, Dominic had already got his surgery.</span></p><p><span>“Top surgery saved my life,” Dominic shared. From time to time, the star even takes it to his socials to share pictures of his past and present self, to express how lucky he’s been to come this far.</span></p><p><span>But Dominic isn’t completely satisfied with how things are — like how people discriminate and attack the trans community. Thus, he often speaks up over his socials praying for a change. “We know that we won’t change for this world to be a better place for everyone. We know that we are the change, and so are you,” he once shared.</span></p><h3><b>Dominic Anthony Green Parents</b></h3><p><span>Dominic Anthony comes from a Christian family.
