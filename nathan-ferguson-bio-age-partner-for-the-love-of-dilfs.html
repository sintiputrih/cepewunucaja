He came into the show looking for a few well-thought-out qualities he wanted in a daddy. First on the list was compassion.</p><p>He told the outlet, ‚ÄúSomeone patient enough to stick through my downfalls and my successes. I prefer older guys because they‚Äôre mature and they know what they want. In terms of values, I want someone who‚Äôs creative and spiritual. Who values kindness and communication.‚Äù</p><p>And Nathan also knows how to treat his other half like a king. He shared, ‚ÄúI love to spoil my man. When I‚Äôm with someone, I‚Äôm all in. I want to be your ride or die and I have your back to hype you up no matter what.‚Äù Nathan then added, ‚ÄúI expect to be treated the same way. I want a best friend and a partner, ya know?‚Äù</p><p>He also desires to treat him like a king when he finally locates him. Nathan added, ‚ÄúWhen a daddy leans in close and whispers something in my ear‚Ä¶especially when we‚Äôre at a bar or a party or something, it literally makes my knees go weak. I love dirty talk in the bedroom too! The more verbal the better.&nbsp;Woof!‚Äù</p><p>For the uninitiated, from the creators of Slag Wars and Hot Haus, For The Love of DILFs will air on OUTtv. It matches up two groups of gay guys and makes them get to know one another to determine if there is a connection. One lucky pair will not only find love but will also get a cash prize of $10,000 as an investment in their future union if they are chosen as the couple most likely to succeed.</p><p>For The Love Of DILFs is already must-see television even though not a single episode has yet to air. If you combine five daddies and five himbos in one home, you can be sure that lots of drama and sparks will soon fly. We eagerly await the outcome of this. In addition to having a cast of hot gay guys looking for love, the show is also hosted by Stormy Daniels, who serves as both the host and the men‚Äôs buddy (and occasionally counselor) while they are in the home hoping for a genuine romantic connection.</p><p>Other contestants on the show are, Daddies (<a href=#>Alex Tikas</a>, Randel Toney, Bobby Knight, Gordon Osborne, and Jeffrey Marc) & Himbos (<a href=#>Mateo Escobar</a>, Phoenix, Tokeyo, and <a href=#>Tony Cannoli</a>).</p><h3><strong>Nathan Ferguson Partner</strong></h3><p>Nathan Ferguson‚Äôs current relationship is unclear. But, he was previously in a relationship with his partner Matthew back in 2018. He had shared his life story with <a href=#>Project Skinny Boy</a> where he had mentioned his then-partner.</p><p>As an update to the original interview, he shared at the time, ‚ÄúSo the first picture is our last date of the yearüòè The second picture is the night after our first date üëÄ. Guess we jumped in and now we‚Äôre here, and I‚Äôm so ready for memories chapters accomplishments and a new year with you You‚Äôre a genuine person and a great friend, lover, doctor, chef, nurse, and everything I could ask for.
