However, the Times Union’s decision to publish an article that mocked us as ‘childless’ is a new low and is truly heinous and wildly inappropriate,” Stefanik said.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">The Albany Times Union front page on January 19, 2021.<span class=credit>Times Union</span></figure><p>“The shameful statement is not only inherently sexist, but also hateful, abusive, and heartless. The Times Union publisher, editors, and staff have clearly let the paper’s standards sink so low that they have chosen to embrace sexist scum and content under the masthead. They should be ashamed,” she continued.&nbsp;</p><p>“We not only require a complete retraction, but we also demand an immediate public apology and explanation as to how this was allowed to be published in the Times Union and who will be held responsible and accountable,” Stefanik said, adding that she and her husband are “grateful to the thousands of constituents who have encouraged and prayed for us over the years.”</p><p>“Like millions of families, we hope and pray that we will be blessed by becoming parents,” she said.</p><img decoding=async alt=Stefanik2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Stefanik2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Stefanik2.jpg alt=Stefanik2 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p>Rep.
