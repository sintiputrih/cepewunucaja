things that we are wanting to fight for, it doesn’t matter if our votes don’t count,’ Cawthorn told the crowd of around 350-400 people. ‘Because, you know, if our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, then it’s going to lead to one place — and it’s bloodshed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I will tell you, as much as I am willing to defend our liberty at all costs, there is nothing that I would dread doing more than having to pick up arms against a fellow American,’ he added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And the way that we can have recourse against that is if we all passionately demand that we have election security in all 50 states.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Video of Cawthorn’s remarks were posted to the Macon County Republican Party Facebook page. On the page, Cawthorn was also pictured at the event signing a camouflage shotgun that could be won via raffle.</p><img decoding=async id=i-d633610f656aa919 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/31/12/47324463-9943253-image-a-15_1630411164688.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="Also at the Sunday event, Cawthorn signed a shotgun that could be won via a weapons raffle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-d633610f656aa919 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/31/12/47324463-9943253-image-a-15_1630411164688.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="Also at the Sunday event, Cawthorn signed a shotgun that could be won via a weapons raffle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Also at the Sunday event, Cawthorn signed a shotgun that could be won via a weapons raffle</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After those remarks were widely circulated on Twitter – coupled with images of him holding the weapon – it was suggested that Cawthorn was advocating violence to prevent voter fraud.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But a spokesman for the representative said in a Monday statement that Cawthorn was saying the exact opposite.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In his comments, Congressman Cawthorn is CLEARLY advocating for violence not to occur over election integrity questions,’ Luke Ball said. ‘He fears others would erroneously choose that route and strongly states that election integrity issues should be resolved peacefully and never through violence.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cawthorn, Ball continued in the statement, was ‘in no way supporting or advocating for any form of violence.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson also attended the event in Macon County on Sunday and signed the shotgun.</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6yurcPEpaNmq5GuwG6%2F05qdn52iYrynssSrnJ1lpKR6o8HYZphmmqWhuabAz6umqJ5dq7K0wIyfpqtloKe8tbHCraCopl2WtKK1zayrZqWRmba0u81mmpqvpJ28s7qO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
