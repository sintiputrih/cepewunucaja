He loved life. He loved his family. He loved the simple things.”</p><p>She concluded: “He loved me and he loved my brothers and he loved my mom. And we loved him. And we always will. I miss you daddy. I can’t wait to see you again. I won’t ever, ever, ever forget you.

I love this man that helped bring me into this world and raised me and loved my mother and my two amazing siblings. Death is the one thing we all have in common, but never expect. Love you, Dad. Forever and ever.”</p><p>The actress opened up about her father’s diagnosis earlier this month.

Shame,” she captioned the pic.</p><p>In a separate post, the Little Miss Sunshine star encouraged fans to wear face masks amid the pandemic: “This is me saying that if you asked my dada: a mask is FAR LESS uncomfortable than a ventilator. So stfu. And wear your damn mask. Please. No one should go thru this.”</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19, Us Weekly wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
