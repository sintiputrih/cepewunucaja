HFS was established as a platform to acquire hotel franchises and quickly expanded its portfolio by acquiring well-known brands such as Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Ramada, and Super 8.</p><p>In 1997, HFS merged with CUC International, leading to the formation of Cendant Corporation, which further bolstered the company’s diverse range of businesses. The acquisition spree continued, and in 2005, Cendant acquired the renowned Wyndham hotel brand from the Blackstone Group, adding another prestigious name to its collection.</p><p>Following a corporate restructuring in 2006, Cendant spun off its hotel and timeshare businesses to create Wyndham Worldwide. This move allowed Wyndham Hotels & Resorts to operate as an independent entity with a dedicated focus on its hotel operations and franchise model.</p><p>In 2018, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts completed its final spin-off as a separate publicly traded company, solidifying its position as a leading player in the hospitality industry.</p><h2>Wyndham Hotel Group and Acquisitions</h2><p>Under the umbrella of Wyndham Worldwide, <b>Wyndham Hotel Group</b> was composed of over 9,000 hotels under 21 brands, ranging from economy to upscale.
