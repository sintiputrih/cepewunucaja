The anime is based on a novel of the same name, and also had a manga to go along with it. However, after the first season ended in 2020, when will season two come out? Here is what fans should know.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-season-2-of-in-spectre-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is season 2 of In/Spectre coming out?</h2><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>After almost three years of waiting, fans can finally celebrate the new season of In/Spectre. Season 2 will finally be released on January 9, 2023, at 1:05 AM JST. Even though the second season was supposed to be released in October of 2022, it is now confirmed that it will be on January 9th.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-does-the-trailer-show data-injectable=false>What is does the trailer show?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>For those who have not seen the trailer, a lot was going on. One of Kuro’s cousins, Rikka Sakauragawa, appears as if he was also able to survive eating the meat that Kuro ate when he became his new self. It also looks as though this season will introduce Masayuki Muroi and Yuki Onna. All three of these characters have also been heavily promoted on the show’s official website, giving fans yet another indicator that they will more than likely have roles in season two.</p><h2 id=h-what-might-happen-in-season-2 data-injectable=false>What might happen in season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/in-2.jpeg><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>The most obvious thing that will happen in season two is that the relationship between Kuro and Kotoko will be explored much more. Kotoko had already mentioned her affinity for Kuro in the first season, but nothing was made of it. This relationship has a chance to be the focus of the second season.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=false>Kuro will also be gaining more trust in his powers and more of a comfortability with them. The fact that there is so much potential in what Kuro is able to do gives the writers so many different angles that they can take. His development into knowing his limits is also key, as someone with all of the power that he has must be responsible for it. It has been three long years, but fans will soon be rewarded for their patience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6ipWaroJqwtb7EZqqemaOku25%2BjKucpZ2RqLJusMCtnGasopa2rbHRZpinnF2ivLOxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
