The <i>Teen Mom 2</i> star, 24, recently considered getting plastic surgery with Michael “Dr. Miami”&nbsp;Salzhauer&nbsp;to shave down her chin.</p><p><span>“I’ve just been really insecure about my chin for a long time,” Evans exclusively explains to <i>Us Weekly.</i> “I just thought it was really pointy, and ever since getting older, my face is growing.”</span></p><p><span>She even traveled to Florida for a consultation with Dr. Miami, who recently made headlines for his extensive plastic surgery work on Evans’ costar </span><b>Kailyn Lowry</b><span>. But once she spoke with the doctor, she reevaluated her decision.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“When I heard how extensive that surgery is, and how he told me I’d have to get a CT scan and X-rays and the whole nine yards, every single detail, every bone in my jaw, I was like, ‘I don’t want to do this,’” noted the mother of Jace, 6, and Kaiser, 18 months.</p><p><span>The North Carolina native is no stranger to plastic surgery. Several years ago she got a boob job, and this past fall she got temporary Juvederm lip injections. As far as future procedures go, the fitness-loving MTV star doesn’t anticipate having more work done.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/spl1214484_003_jenelle-evans-zoom-f870ea1d-1d01-44cb-9056-ab5b4f6306fd.jpg><p><span>“I think I’m fine with the way I look,” Evans says. “I work out at the gym. If I want a bigger butt, I’m going to work for it. I’m going to build it up with muscle, not implants or injections. If I don’t like my stomach, I’m going to go work out, stay active and healthy, because honestly, you can go get all this work done, but in a couple years, gravity is going to pull all that down, and it’s not going to look that great.”</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>That being said, Evans is still supportive of Lowry’s decision to get a total body makeover.</span></p><p>“She looks great, and I’m happy [for her],” Evans tells <i>Us.</i> “Whatever makes her happy. That’s her choice. It’s just not mine. It’s her decision. It’s her body. No one can tell her what to do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/498165088_david-eason-jenelle-evans-zoom-a3b10a99-e537-4738-8167-7b1a98114e89.jpg><p><span>And though Evans came to the decision to forgo the procedure on her own, her new boyfriend,</span><b> David Eason</b><span>, was not supportive of her going under the knife from the beginning.</span></p><p>“He was totally against it, did not want me getting it done and told me I look completely fine the way I did,” she reveals. “And he was really upset about it for, like, three days.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/502080658_david-eason-jenelle-evans-zoom-03538a32-ef06-4261-93cf-64d81e32eaa3.jpg><p><span>Now, Evans is embracing her natural beauty and encouraging her fans and other young girls out there to do the same.</span></p><p>“You can’t live your life miserable,” she says.</p><p>As for<i> Teen Mom OG</i> star <b>Farrah Abraham</b>, who has had numerous surgeries, enhancements and alterations, Evans remained neutral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/462121218_farrah-abraham-zoom-37b1ff9f-c943-4187-ab93-e58c43eabb33.jpg><p><span>“She does look good, but she looks weird compared to what I’m used to seeing her look like in the past,” she admits. “But like I said, in 10 to 20 years, it’s all going to change, and then she’s going to have to get more to fix that, and then that’s going to spend more money — and is she going to have the money?”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6aua2xjJ6tmqajYryxsc2sZK6oXZavsMHTZqWorF2csrXAyKeeZqiclsC1tcJmqq6ql5q%2FunnOp2ShnaJisKm1zWauam5iaoZxew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
