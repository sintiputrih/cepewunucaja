However, in May 2022, Sofia’s mother took to Instagram to celebrate her daughter’s last day of high school.</p><p>In September of the same year, the famous actress announced on Instagram that she had taken her daughter to college for the first time. She added that although it was the proudest moment for her, it was also a painful moment leaving her daughter in the dorm. However, reports suggest Sofia enrolled in another institution in February 2023 after concluding the first wasn’t a good fit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Sofia_Bella_Pagans_Parents></span>Who Are Sofia Bella Pagán’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia’s parents are actors. Her mother, Leah Remini, is an accomplished, multi-award-winning American actress who started acting in 1988.

While there have been questions on whether or not Sofia is adopted, the truth is that her parents did not adopt her. Sofia Bella Pagán was born only a year after her parents married. The love story between her parents began in 1996 when the pair met for the first time in a Cuban restaurant and nightclub.</p><p>It was love at first song and dance for Leah Remini and <a href=#>Angelo Pagán</a>, who started dating shortly after. After several years together, Pagán proposed to Remini at an LA restaurant on Christmas Eve in 2002. The following year, the lovebirds tied the knot at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas on July 19, 2003.</p><p>Afterward, the couple announced their pregnancy, and the actress took her fans through her pregnancy journey as well as the birth of her daughter. After Sofia, her parents had no more kids and saw no reason to adopt more kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-24-49-fotor-2023090133224.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Sofia_Bella_Pagan_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Sofia Bella Pagán Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the celebrity kid is the only child her parents have together, she is not the only child of her father.
