In an early quest, The Daedalian Keys, you’re tasked with finding 16 Daedalian Keys around Hogwarts, and they’re not easy to locate. This guide outlines where all the Daedalian Keys are, so you can complete this quest in no time at all.</p><h2>Every Daedalian Key location in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><p data-injection=true>Here, we’ve broken down each Daedalian Key location, explaining where it is as well as which Floo Flame you should use to reach it quickly.</p><h3>Daedalian Key 1: Astronomy Tower</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hogwarts-legacy-daedalian-key-1-astronomy-tower.jpg><p data-injection=true>The first Daedalian Key you’ll be pointed to is located in the Astronomy Tower. The nearest Floo Flame you can travel to is the <strong>Astronomy Tower</strong> one itself. Once there, head up the stairs opposite the Floo Flame, and you’ll see the key straight away. Follow it back down the stairs and into the nearby classroom, where it will be hovering in front of a cabinet. Slap the key to unlock the cabinet, and you’ll have completed this first part of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daedalian Keys quest</a>.</p><h3>Daedalian Key 2: The Grand Staircase</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hogwarts-legacy-daedalian-key-3-defence-against-the-dark-arts-classroom.jpg><p data-injection=true>To find this key, travel to <strong>The Grand Staircase Tower Floo Flame</strong>. Head down The Grand Staircase, and you should eventually come across the Daedalian Key as you do. It’ll fly further down the staircase, so follow it for a few more floors. You’ll come to a landing where you can see a puzzle door to your right. Keep running, and the cabinet will be just beyond it down the hall.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy roll door puzzle solution — How to open animal symbol doors</a></p><h3>Daedalian Key 3: Defence Against The Dark Arts Classroom</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hogwarts-legacy-daedalian-key-2-the-grand-staircase.jpg><p>Travel to the <strong>Defence Against The Dark Arts Floo Flame</strong> for this key. Run down the stairs from the Floo Flame to the rhinoceros skeleton. The key is inside and will fly upstairs as soon as you arrive.
