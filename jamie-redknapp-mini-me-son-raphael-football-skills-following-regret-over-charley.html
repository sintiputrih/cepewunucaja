Jamie famously wore numbers 15 and 11 while playing for Liverpool, but he made reference to Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham with his son's cute blue football jersey featuring the number five on the back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb8c432e56a7-3996210503460838245771415919835420432194707n.jpg><p id=ejmvH6kvdh9 data-wc=35>Raphael teamed the shirt with cream trousers and white and red trainers, which were visible as he did a celebratory stance after scoring his goal.

"Meet Raphael Anders Redknapp, we're so in love, mum is doing so well too," he captioned the image. "We can't thank the amazing doctors and nurses at the Chelsea and Westminster enough.

Let’s go do something,' and he’d go, 'I don’t really want to dad'. I’d reply, 'Why? Why don’t you want to come out and play football?'. But why should he? Just because I played football, it doesn’t make it right for him.</p><p id=ezF9FMDHykh data-wc=41>"Everyone's different, you've got to manage that childhood right because if you don't, you end up falling out with your son. I actually regret how I was with Charlie a little bit. I pushed him and he shouldn't have been pushed."</p><p id=ef2Mn8Qr9B data-wc=12><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Louise Redknapp's sultry black bustier wedding dress for whirlwind yacht nuptials</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
