You see, these two gunslingers have a long history that dates back to Boba Fett’s youth. When he was just starting to gain his footing in the galactic underworld, it was Bane who took him in as his protege and taught Boba the ropes of bounty hunting. But Bane’s connection to Boba goes even further than that: Boba’s father, Jango, also mentored Bane.</p><p>Boba and Bane aren’t friends, though. When they find themselves on opposite sides of a conflict in an unfinished episode of <strong>The Clone Wars</strong>, the two duel and end up shooting each other in the head — this is how Boba’s helmet acquired its famous dent! Meanwhile, Bane wears the scar in the form of a metal plate reinforcing his skull. Needless to say, Bane is likely hungry for a rematch and a little revenge.</p><p>Corey Burton once again voiced Cad Bane for his first live action appearance, but it’s stuntman Dorian Kingi who plays the character in the actual scene. His stunt work has previously appeared in <strong>The Suicide Squad</strong>, <strong>Venom</strong>, <strong>Westworld</strong>, and many others.</p><h2>Cobb Vanth (Timothy Olyphant)</h2><p>Timothy Olyphant does an even better job the second time around as marshal Cobb Vanth. Although his desert town of Mos Pelgo might have been renamed Freetown in the months after <strong>The Mandalorian</strong> season 2, there’s no doubt that Cobb is still the law in those parts, as those Pyke spice runners quickly learn. Unfortunately, the fastest blaster in Freetown is no match for a veteran like Cad Bane. The duel is over for poor Cobb before it even begins in “From the Desert Comes a Stranger.” But is the marshal truly dead?</p><h2>Ahsoka Tano (Rosario Dawson)</h2><p><strong>The Book of Boba Fett</strong> finally delivers the scene many fans have long waited for: Ahsoka Tano and Luke Skywalker standing side by side as Jedi friends in the years after the fall of the Empire. In “From the Desert Comes a Stranger,” Ahsoka watches as Luke takes his first steps as a teacher to Grogu, and is present for the construction of the new temple that will one day house a whole new generation of Jedi.</p><p>Rosario Dawson dons the makeup once again for this episode and it won’t be the last time. She’s getting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her own spin-off series</a> on Disney+. In fact, it reportedly begins filming this spring!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOrZ%2BeZZKkvKx5zp9km6eSlnqnsdOtZJ6omai8pbGMb2ScmZ2avLR5zZ6uZpuRqMFurc2dZJygkaeupMDEq6pmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
