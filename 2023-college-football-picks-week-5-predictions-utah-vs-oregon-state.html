This week in Friday college football action, the Utah Utes battle the Oregon State Beavers in late-week Pac-12 action. 
This is, low-key, a monstrous game. 
It’s a top-20 matchup that includes a top-10 team (Utah) on the road against a team that rarely loses at home (the Beavers have won 14 of their last 15 in Corvallis)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Utes are 4-0 by running the ball and playing shutdown defense.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if Rising plays this Friday, the Utes likely won’t push it or try to overhaul the offense – again, Utah is 4-0 for a reason. I’d expect Utah to continue pounding the rock behind the three-headed “monster” of Jaylon Glover, Nate Johnson and Ja’Quinden Jackson.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/utah-oregon-state.jpg><p>I’d expect the same from Oregon State. The Beavers can move the football, but it’s all on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>DJ Uiagelelei is far from fixed. After two great games against San Jose State and UC Davis, he’s regressed against San Diego State and Washington State. He completed less than 50% of his passes across the two games, with a Passing Success Rate of around 40%.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind Damien Martinez, Deshaun Fenwick and an experienced offensive line, the Beavers are averaging over 225 rushing yards per game at over six yards per carry. But they’re a one-dimensional attack running into a dominant front seven.&nbsp;</p><p>The Utes have the best front seven in the Pac-12. Nine starters returned from last year’s defense. Defensive end Jonah Elliss and linebacker Karene Reid are having big years already, at least by Pro Football Focus’s metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>The Utes rank top-15 nationally in points per game allowed (9.6), EPA per Rush allowed, and Rush Success Rate allowed. They’ve played ULCA, Baylor and Florida, so their numbers have come against legit Power Five competition.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/utah-oregon-state-odds.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betting on College Football?</h2><p>Ultimately, Utah’s defense should shut down Oregon State’s one-dimensional attack – especially behind a pristine gameplan from Kyle Whittingham – and Utah’s offense won’t push the ball downfield, Rising or no rising.&nbsp;</p><p>Add in a rainy weather report, and we should expect an ugly, rush-heavy game script that drains the clock and results in a low-scoring contest.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Utah vs. Oregon State pick</h2><p><strong>Under 44.5 (-110, <a href=#>BetMGM</a>)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3FfZ31zf4ycpqWklZyybrLOqKubmZyherG1wqSqZq%2BVmrhugYypqZ6cmZjBqrvNrGSurJGdere%2FjKipnp%2Bfo3q0wMCtnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
