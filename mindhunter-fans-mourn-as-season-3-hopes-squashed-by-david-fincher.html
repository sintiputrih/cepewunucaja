At the time, it was believed executive producer David Fincher’s busy schedule was to blame. Now we know the culprit was actually Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>In speaking with the French magazine <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Journal du Dimanche</a>, Fincher said he’s “very proud of the first two seasons. But it’s a very expensive show and, in the eyes of Netflix, we didn’t attract enough of an audience to justify such an investment.”</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>He also said, “I don’t blame them, they took risks to get the show off the ground, gave me the means to do Mank the way I wanted to do it and they allowed me to venture down new paths with The Killer. It’s a blessing to be able to work with people who are capable of boldness. The day our desires are not the same, we have to be honest about parting ways.”</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>Just like that, any and all hope for a third season went out the window. As a long-time collaborator of Netflix, it’s clear Fincher is not in the market of tarnishing the platform’s name, but the same can’t be said of the fans.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Rallying together in their ire, the fandom turned to Twitter to express their frustration at being strung along for four years and at Netflix for not recognizing quality if it spat in its face.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netflix will spend millions of dollars on stuff they’ll cancel after one season after not even promoting it.
