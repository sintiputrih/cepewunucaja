Less than one week after the WGA writers strike ended, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, John Oliver, and Jimmy Fallon stepped into their respective studios and welcomed a live audience for the first time since May. While they have not sat at those specific desks in a hot minute, the five hosts came together briefly to form the supergroup podcast <a href=#>Strike Force Five</a> to give themselves something to do before eventually breaking off into their separate shows. With a full lineup ahead of them this week, here’s how each host monologued their return to late night, just in time for the debut of <a href=#>Traylor</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln9qm7yt001a3b7h78660k0y@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln9r16pp000i3b7jk1rj5t02@published data-word-count=84>Colbert came back with a two-part monologue and with the unfortunate update that his wife Evie “refused to keep chanting” his name, much like a studio audience would. “Thanks to the picket lines, my writers got free air and sunshine, which they do not care for that,” proclaimed Colbert in the first half. He stated that they have been off the air for “154 indictment” before going into a much-needed bit about Trump’s mug shot and the unclaimed coke found in the White House.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln9sh3mb002n3b7jeg6mjn7n@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln9skhjl003h3b7jtzak8b8e@published data-word-count=74>Kimmel begins his show with an intimate therapy session with the king of coming back, Arnold Schwarzenegger, before Arnie yells at him to get to the chopper. He dodges some pickleball players who have been renting out the studio while they were off the air and suggests they try James Corden’s spot. Kimmel cleverly points out that they’ve been gone so long that “the Bachelor is now a <a href=#>grandfather</a>” before getting to Trump’s arrests.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln9rjn4n000u3b7jts6bvyg6@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Late Night With Seth Meyers</span></h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Late Night with Seth Meyers (@latenightseth)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln9rs1lg002d3b7jb4hnwkte@published data-word-count=43>Meyers began the show by thanking the WGA negotiating committee and sharing how much he missed working with his writing staff. “I was so happy to see them this morning. I will admit by lunch, I was a little over it,” Meyers joked.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln9viw1p00623b7ja54yd0dy@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln9vizln00673b7ji8lbkxe8@published data-word-count=73>Coming back live from the “Spirit Halloween” studio, Fallon came in hot with Travis Kelce–Taylor Swift jokes since he knows Swifties are still looking for Easter eggs from <a href=#>their past interviews</a> together. While Fallon doesn’t address his own <a href=#>controversy</a> that unraveled during the hiatus, he did set a spherical <a href=#>Bono</a> loose into the audience while making fun of his own bit. “I should mention not all of the writers are back,” joked Fallon.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln9wnud500733b7jpodgsc6i@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Last Week Tonight With John Oliver</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln9wr9rm007g3b7j0qx1d7vy@published data-word-count=86>Oliver acknowledged the hard work that the Writers Guild did to be able to earn their historic wins and used their concerns, like health care, to segue into this week’s topic. He began, “Our industry has seen its workers severely squeezed in recent years; you might have seen stories about writers and actors, whose work you recognize, routinely not making enough to qualify for health insurance or afford basic needs, so the Writers Guild went on strike and thankfully won,” before diving into prison health-care reform.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cln1w52ls00000ih4v5ucidmd@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Strike Force Five Return to Their Day Jobs</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cln8gcddb001f0iept8pq5bcr@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>John Oliver Praises WGA During First Post-Strike Last Week Tonight</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clmt789w000000if4kqo0o104@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Strike Force Five Heralds Podcasting’s First True Supergroup</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Late-Night Hosts Have a Lot to Catch Up On</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnytrdOeZKehl53BbrnOp6alp5eqsm63yKaknqRdmLytrsSrq2aekaG5sLqMppyynaKoerC4yK%2Bcq2aYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
