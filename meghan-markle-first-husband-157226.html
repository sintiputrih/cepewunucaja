Morton wrote that Meghan was the person who actually wanted to end the marriage and the separation was “totally out of the blue” for Trevor. “[He] went from cherishing Meghan to, as one friend observed, ‘feeling like he was a piece of something stuck to the bottom of her shoe,'” the author explained.</p><p>Today, Meghan is happily engaged to Prince Harry and the pair is set to exchange vows at Windsor Castle’s St George’s Chapel on Saturday, May 19.
