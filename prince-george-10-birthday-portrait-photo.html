During the outing, George nearly twinned with his dad in matching brown suede shoes. He paired the shoes with a blue polo shirt and green jeans. Meanwhile, his dad rocked a blue suit with a light-blue button up shirt. Kate looked chic in a cream-colored blazer and blue slacks. Her daughter opted for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>striped black-and-white dress</a>, while their five-year-old son opted for an all-blue outfit. Louis rocked a blue sweater with shorts and a white collared shirt underneath.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FqZqmqmaOwpnnGnqarn5VifnF5waKpraCUlsZuvM6rq6uZmal6sbTOraZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
