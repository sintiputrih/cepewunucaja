Learn all about her as this Noelle Dunphy Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Noelle Dunphy, Rudy Giuliani Accuser</b></h3><p><span>Noelle Dunphy initially filed a $3.1 million lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, claiming he demanded s*xual favors and created a “toxic” work environment before firing her and stiffing her for work in January 2023.</span></p><p><span>During the summons, she claimed that she worked for the former mayor as “an off-the-books, secret employee” between 2019 through 2021. Allegedly, right on the first day of her job, Rudy kissed Dunphy in the back seat of a limo and asked her to send “some flirtatious photos,” leaving her “stunned and shaken.” His behavior then only got worst as he asked her invasive questions about her s*xual history, and then forced her to perform oral s*x the same month.</span></p><p><span>According to her, he forced her to perform oral s*x while he was on calls with high-profile friends and clients because he said it made him “feel like Bill Clinton.” He reportedly</span> <span>even forbade her from seeing or talking to anyone on the phone without his approval and developed a “habit of calling her obsessively” —&nbsp; including 50 times on Feb. 12, 2019.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Noelle constantly “worked under the virtually constant threat that Giuliani might initiate s*xual contact at any moment.”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Noelle accused Rudy of making “racist, bigoted, and anti-Semitic as well as anti-LGBTQ and anti-woman” remarks; especially while drunk.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, Noelle claimed the former mayor never paid her the nearly $2 million she was promised in compensation for her work and she was unceremoniously fired in January 2021. She believed it was because he couldn’t use the money until he could settle his divorce from his third wife, Judith.</span></p><p><span>Now, Noelle’s asking for $10 million in damages!</span></p><h3><b>Noelle Dunphy Age</b></h3><p><span>Noelle Dunphy was 43 years of age when she accused Rudy Giuliani of s*xual abuse and wage theft in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She is 35 years younger than the former mayor.</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span>Noelle was 36 when she first met Rudy in September 2016.
