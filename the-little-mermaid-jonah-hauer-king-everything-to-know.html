The actor went on to star in A Dog’s Way Home alongside Bryce Dallas Howard, and received acclaim for portraying Harry in the BBC drama World on Fire, which recently filmed season two.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Jonah plays Prince Eric in The Little Mermaid</figure><p id=eEY1rcHvk29 data-wc=76>The actor is also set to star as Lale in the adaptation of the bestselling novel, The Tattooist of Auschwitz. In April, he confirmed that filming had been completed via Instagram, writing: “That’s a wrap for me on the Tattooist of Auschwitz — a journey that started back in March 2022. Thank you to all the incredible crew, cast, writers and producers for such a challenging and formative 3 months of filming. Will never forget it.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6e93fffc6f0-3056887891616741531310876056480244430268136n.jpg><p id=eJf6ELq91eF data-wc=92>Director Rob Marshall recently opened up about Jonah as Prince Eric in The Little Mermaid, particularly in regards to the new original song written for the live-action version. He said: “We realized, of course, Eric had no song in the original. I don’t know anything about him! So it was very obvious we needed to give him an ‘I Want’ song. It’s his ‘Part of Your World.’ And [with it], he becomes a three-dimensional character. It’s a different genre. You’re moving from a 2D piece to a 3D piece with real people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c5fa247f083b-3492255609237354155433497904778475693357038n.jpg><p id=ei9eveUOqAx data-wc=73>Jonah added: “We get to know him so well through this song. We understand him so much better. We understand what he’s longing for and what his hopes and his dreams are. And we understand some of his frustration and his pain and longing for this girl that saved him and longing for something bigger. Obviously, it was sort of terrifying because I knew that meant that I’d be singing next to Halle.”</p><p id=eCvn_ZmnGE data-wc=14><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Remember little Jack from Room?
